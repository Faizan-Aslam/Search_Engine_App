142314.0,0,Acura,"Acura is the luxury and performance division of Japanese automaker Honda. The brand was launched in the United States and Canada on March 27, 1986, marketing luxury and performance automobiles. It was introduced to Hong Kong in 1991 (lasting until 2009), Mexico in 2004, China in 2006, Russia in 2014 (no longer available in Russia), Kuwait in 2015, and was also sold in Ukraine (until 2018). Honda's plan to introduce Acura to the Japanese domestic market (JDM) in 2008 was delayed, due to economic reasons, and later withheld as a result of the financial crisis of 2007–2008.Acura is the first Japanese automotive luxury brand. The creation of Acura coincided with the introduction of a JDM Honda dealership sales channel, called Honda Clio, which sold luxury vehicles, joining previously established Honda Verno, followed by Honda Primo the following year. In its first few years of existence, Acura was among the best-selling luxury marques in the US, outselling established brands such as BMW and Mercedes-Benz. Though sales were down in the mid-to-late 1990s, the brand experienced a revival in the early 2000s, due to drastic redesigns and the introductions of new models.In the late 1980s, the success of the company's first flagship vehicle, the Legend, inspired fellow Japanese automakers Toyota and Nissan to launch their own luxury brands, Lexus and Infiniti, respectively. The 1990 launch of the NSX, a mid-engine exotic sports car, offered a reliable and practical alternative to exotic European sports cars, and introduced Honda's VTEC variable valve timing system to the North American market. The 1993 Legend coupé featured Acura's first use of a six-speed manual transmission mated to a Type II engine. In the late 1990s, Acura produced a Type R version of its compact Integra, which featured a reduced curb weight, a stiffer and lower suspension, and a high-output VTEC engine.
In the early 2000s, Acura introduced new models, including the company's first all-original SUV, the MDX, and two models which replaced the Integra coupé and sedan, the RSX and TSX, respectively. Type-S versions of the RSX, CL, and TL were added to the brand's lineup during that decade. Acura's 2005 RL flagship introduced SH-AWD, a torque-vectoring all-wheel drive system. The 2007 RDX, a crossover SUV, featured the first North American use of a turbocharged Honda engine. A second generation NSX was launched in 2016 and features a twin-turbocharged mid-engine, a nine-speed dual-clutch transmission, and Sport Hybrid SH-AWD.

The CL is often thought to have been a replacement for the Acura Legend coupe.  It was not directly related to the first gen TL either, a Japanese-built model which replaced the Vigor and had a longitudinal engine layout. With the advent of the 2nd gen TL in 1999, the transverse engined CL became more precisely a TL coupe. All Acura CLs were built at Honda's plant in East Liberty, Ohio, which is also the plant that builds the Honda Civic.  The 2nd genTL and the Honda Accord upon which the Acura CLs were based, are built at Honda's plant in Marysville, Ohio, a few miles away from East Liberty. The CL was the first Acura to be built in the United States.
Following the end of the 1995 model year, the Acura Legend coupe disappeared from Acura's lineup when the sedan version was renamed the Acura RL. The CL was not a direct replacement for the Legend coupe as it no longer shared the same chassis as its sedan counterpart, and was not made in Japan, unlike the RL. Because Acura no longer had a suitable Legend coupe replacement, they created this vehicle. With the release of the TL and 3.5RL in 1996, Acura transitioned to alphanumeric and/or two-letter names, naming of all of its vehicles (with the exception of the Integra, which kept its name until the 2001 model year). Although the CL was considered to be a satisfactory vehicle, it never gained traction or popularity like the other Acura coupes."

It was the first flagship sedan sold under the Acura nameplate, until being renamed in 1996 as the Acura 3.5RL. The 3.5RL was the North American version of the KA9 series Honda Legend.
The opportunity for Japanese manufacturers to export more expensive models had arisen with the 1980s voluntary export restraints, negotiated by the Japanese government and U.S. trade representatives, restricting mainstream car sales.

AUDIX features many integrations with Avaya PBXes, such as capturing the extension of the calling party and announcing that person's name (if they're also an AUDIX subscriber and have recorded their name on the system) when announcing the attributes of a message, automatic identification of subscribers when they are dialing in to retrieve their messages, and activating and deactivating message-waiting indicators.It can also serve as a recording device.  A subscriber with an appropriately administered feature button on their phone can press said button and within a few seconds, the station will be conferenced with AUDIX and AUDIX will record the conversation.  The recording will be stored like a voice mail.
AUDIX systems are based on Unix, and share some software with Avaya's Conversant interactive voice response (IVR) platform.  Early forms of unified messaging appeared in the late 1980s; earlier AUDIX releases interoperated with System V mail servers and with System 85 PBXes, when AT&T still owned UNIX.  Many of the same status and control programs are used to operate AUDIX and Conversant systems, but an AUDIX system is geared specifically to serving up voicemail and is not a general IVR platform.

As a subsidiary of its parent company, the Volkswagen Group, Audi produces vehicles in nine production facilities worldwide.
The origins of the company are complex, going back to the early 20th century and the initial enterprises (Horch and the Audiwerke) founded by engineer August Horch; and two other manufacturers (DKW and Wanderer), leading to the foundation of Auto Union in 1932. The modern era of Audi essentially began in the 1960s when Auto Union was acquired by Volkswagen from Daimler-Benz. After relaunching the Audi brand with the 1965 introduction of the Audi F103 series, Volkswagen merged Auto Union with NSU Motorenwerke in 1969, thus creating the present-day form of the company.
The company name is based on the Latin translation of the surname of the founder, August Horch. Horch, meaning ""listen"" in German, becomes audi in Latin. The four rings of the Audi logo each represent one of four car companies that banded together to create Audi's predecessor company, Auto Union. Audi's slogan is Vorsprung durch Technik, meaning ""Being Ahead through Technology"".

The car was rebadged six weeks later by Volkswagen as the Volkswagen Polo with a wider range of engine and other options. The Volkswagen Polo was launched in the home market in September 1974 and appeared in export markets, including the United Kingdom, a few months later.
The car was offered as a three door hatchback with a 1,093 cc (66.7 cu in) petrol engine, producing either 37 kW (50 PS; 50 bhp) or 44 kW (60 PS; 59 bhp) for the LS and GL models, respectively. The model was popular in Europe, both because of its generous specifications for a car of the time, and on account of its relatively low price. The Volkswagen and Audi badged models were sold alongside each other for three years until 1978, but the cheaper Volkswagen Polo outsold the Audi 50 almost immediately, and Audi discontinued the Audi 50 in 1978, after a total production of 180,812 units. A planned facelift, which would have given the Audi 50 a look closer to that of the Audi 100 and Audi 80 was never implemented, because of a holding company board decision that the Audi brand should concentrate on larger, more expensive cars.
The Volkswagen Polo range continued to evolve, with the Volkswagen Derby notchback version, despite being developed by Audi at Ingolstadt, branded as a Volkswagen and launched in 1977.  Subsequently, the Volkswagen Polo has evolved through numerous generations to the present day.

Its engine was a shortened version of the eight-cylinder in-line engine used by sister company Horch. The car was planned to occupy a niche in the Auto Union range between the large Horch products and the middle market cars produced by Wanderer. Audi had no stand-alone production facilities at that time and the car was produced, like its predecessor, at the Horch plant.
The 920 featured a front-mounted six-cylinder in-line engine with a displacement of 3,281 cc. A maximum output of 75 PS (55 kW; 74 hp) at 3,000 rpm was claimed along with a maximum speed of 130 km/h (81 mph). A floor-mounted lever controlled the four-speed gearbox: this delivered power to the rear wheels, which represented a technological retreat from the innovative front-wheel drive configuration of the 920’s predecessor. The box-section chassis featured semi-independent suspension at the front and a swing-axle arrangement at the rear.

Due to the war taking place, Auto Union could not create a successor to the vehicle. After the war ended, some Auton Union factories were located in East Germany, which became a part of the Eastern Bloc, which made Auton Union unable to create a replacement, however, using the assets for the creation of the Audi 920, HQM Sachsenring GmbH created the similarly sized Horch P240 limousine."

The circuit, which was sponsored by the German car manufacturer Audi, ran annually throughout Southern Europe and attracted some of the best sailors in the world. The five-regatta circuit lasted five months starting in May and culminated in September.
The circuit was based on a box rule where every boat, in theory, had a similar design. This left it to the skill of the sailors to decide the winner, much like Formula One. There is some leverage in the rule in that deck layouts can be adjusted and sails can be crafted differently but the main design features such as weight, beam, and mast height and sail area are restricted to this ""box rule"" standard. 
While originally sailed only on TP 52s, the Audi MedCup in 2009 became a two class regatta with the introduction of the GP42 class. In 2011 the GP42 was replaced as the second class by the One Design Soto 40.
It costs roughly 2.5 million Euros to build a brand new TP52 on which to race, and an additional five hundred thousand to one million Euros for sails and deck gear. This plus the added cost of maintaining the yacht and running a professional sailing campaign made the Audi MedCup one of the most expensive sailing circuits in the world."

The R8 TDI Le Mans has modified suspension settings and brakes to cope with the additional power and weight (300 kg (661.4 lb)), resulting from replacing the standard V8 engine with the V12 TDI. The V12 TDI requires more cooling than the standard R8, hence a NACA duct is incorporated in the roof to feed additional air into the engine. The vents on the front and back of the car have also been increased by 20% in size. The car all-LED headlamps which were first seen on the Audi Le Mans Quattro concept. For its appearance at the Detroit Motor Show, Audi fitted 20 inch alloy wheels.  The rear bulkhead has been moved forward in order to accommodate the physically larger V12 engine, meaning it loses the space behind the rear seats usually found on the standard R8.
In May 2009, Audi decided to halt plans for possible production of the R8 TDI, citing ""the cost of re-engineering the petrol R8 to accommodate the massive twin-turbocharged diesel engine is simply too great – and that it would be unable to recoup its investment through sales alone""."

Collaboratively designed as a joint venture between Audi AG and Porsche and built on Audi's 80 Avant, designated internally as P1 (instead of B4/8C that it was based on). It was Audi's first ""RS"" vehicle, and the first of their high-performance Avants (Audi's name for an estate car or station wagon); it used the most powerful and most thoroughly developed version of Audi's inline-five cylinder turbocharged engine.
Although it was not widely exported outside of Europe, except for a few to Hong Kong, South Africa, Brazil, Canada, the United States and New Zealand, the RS 2 has amassed a cult following worldwide, and it is often regarded as being the vehicle that finally firmly established Audi as a producer of practical high-performance vehicles: its estate body, seating for five persons, and Audi's 'trademark' quattro permanent four-wheel-drive system as standard made it usable as a comfortable daily driver, even in poor weather conditions."

The RS 4 was reintroduced in 2012, based on the A4 Avant instead of the sedan as did the original model.
The original B5 version was produced only as an Avant, Audi's name for an estate car/station wagon. The second version, the B7, was released initially as a four-door five-seat saloon/sedan, with the Avant following a short while later. A two-door four-seat Cabriolet version was subsequently added. 
The ""RS"" initials are taken from the German RennSport—literally translated as ""racing sport"", and is the Audi marque's highest trim level, positioned above the ""S"" model specification of Audi's regular model line-up. Like other Audi ""RS"" cars, the RS 4 pioneers some of Audi's latest advanced technology. It is only available with Audi's Torsen-based ""trademark"" quattro permanent four-wheel drive system.

The original Audi S4, built from 1991 until 1994, was a performance-oriented version of Audi's 100 saloon/sedan.  All subsequent S4s since 1997 have been based on the Audi A4; and as the A4 has evolved from one generation to the next, so has the S4.
A more powerful internal combustion engine, larger upgraded brakes, firmer suspension, larger wheels, and distinctive sheetmetal, styling clues and badging have always been amongst the many upgrades the S4 receives over its mainstream 100 and A4 siblings. In markets where the even higher-performance Audi RS 4 is not offered, the S4 is the top-of-the-line trim of the A4 family.Like its regular A4 counterpart, all S4 variants have had longitudinally oriented, front-mounted engines.  A single turbocharged 2.2-litre inline five-cylinder powered the original C4 version, and a 2.7-litre twin turbocharged V6 engine was found in the B5 generation. The B6 and B7 versions shared a common 4.2-litre V8 engine, the first time that a V8 engine was placed in a compact executive car, placing it in direct competition with the BMW M3 which at the time had a 3.2 L inline 6. The B8 generation uses a supercharged 3.0-litre V6 TFSI engine and competes with the BMW 335i. The recently introduced B9 generation is powered by a turbocharged 3.0-litre V6 TFSI engine, as opposed to a supercharger like in the previous iteration.All versions of the S4 have their transmission mounted immediately at the rear of the engine in a longitudinal orientation, in the form of a transaxle, and like all Audi ""S"" cars, are only available as standard with Audi's quattro all-wheel drive (AWD) system, using a Torsen-based centre differential system.All versions of the S4 have been manufactured at Audi's plant in Ingolstadt, Germany; they are, or have been available as a four-door five-seat saloon and a five-door five-seat Avant (Audi's name for an estate car/station wagon) body styles since the model's inception in 1991. A two-door four-seat Cabriolet (convertible) S4 variant was introduced as part of the B6 and B7 generation A4 lineups.

33333572.0,0,Audi Type K,"The Audi Type K was a car introduced by Audi at the Berlin Motor Show in September 1921.   Since the end of the war Audi had till now produced only cars of pre-war design, so that the Type K was the first post-war Audi design to be offered.   The Type K entered production in 1922 and was withdrawn in 1925, by which time the company had commenced production, in 1924, their Type M model which can be seen as a larger replacement for the Type K. The Audi Type K was the first volume produced car in Germany to feature left-hand drive.
In retrospect the car has been seen as one of the most technically advanced cars of its time. It had a four-cylinder in-line engine with 3.6 litres of displacement, incorporating an aluminium cylinder block with replaceable cylinder liners (eingepressten Laufbuchsen).   It developed a maximum of 50 PS (37 kW; 49 hp) at 2200 rpm, which was transmitted to the rear wheels, using a four-speed transmission. Claimed top speed was 95 km/h (59 mph).The car had two leaf-sprung solid axles. It was available as a four-seat touring car, four-door sedan or as a two-door coupé-cabriolet.

33333811.0,0,Audi Type M,"The Audi Type M was a large car first presented at the Berlin Motor Show in 1923 and produced by Audi between 1924 and 1927.The vehicle had a six-cylinder in-line engine with 4,655 cc of displacement. The engine incorporated several innovative features including overhead valves.   It developed a maximum of 70 PS (51 kW; 69 hp) at 3,000 rpm.   Power was transmitted to the rear wheels through a four-speed transmission. The engine had an eight-bearing crankshaft, forced lubrication with oil cooler and a thermostat-controlled water cooling. The car had two leaf-sprung solid axles and four wheel hydraulic brakes. It was the first Audi with four-wheel brakes.The Type M's first presentation, at the 1923 Motor Show, was accompanied by a press release which boasted that ""Audi is one of those German automakers that believes doing the job properly is more important than price"" („Die Audi-Werke zählen zu jenen deutschen Automobilfabriken, welche die Preisfrage hinter die konstruktive Aufgabe zurückstellen“).     This approach may have helped to win the car more admirers, but paying customers were harder to find.   The Type M came with a manufacturer's recommended retail price of 22,300 Marks for a large six-light ""Pullman-Limousine"" bodied vehicle.   The car was expensive and reportedly brought Audi very close to bankruptcy. 228 were produced, plus two prototypes."

33334787.0,0,Audi Type R,"The Audi Type R  was a large car produced by Audi between 1928 and 1932 as a successor to the Audi Type M.The Type R closely resembled the predecessor model, which had been perceived as too expensive.   In reality the Type R was a little smaller than the Type M, its specification was less lavish and its price was lower.   Nevertheless, it remained a large, expensive car produced during a period characterised by increasing austerity as the economy underwent the aftershocks from the stock market crashes and bank failures of 1929.   Like its even more extravagant predecessor the Type R struggled to find customers.The car had an eight-cylinder in-line sidevalve engine with 4,872 cc of displacement. It developed a claimed maximum 100 PS (74 kW; 99 hp) of output at 3,300 rpm, which converted into a top speed of 120 km/h (75 mph).   Gone were the light-metal cylinder head and overhead valves that had excited commentators on the Type M.  The three-speed manual transmission represented a step back from the four-speed transmission of the earlier car, and while the Type R retained four-wheel brakes, these were now mechanically rather than hydraulically controlled.The Type R also lost some of the earlier car's bulk, its 3,620 mm (143 in) wheelbase being 130 mm (5.1 in) shorter than that of the Type M.   The vast Pullmann-Limousine-bodied car was also 200 kg lighter, with an official weight of ""only"" 2,300 kg.   Particularly noteworthy was the price of the Pullmann-Limousine-bodied car, with a manufacturer's listed price of 16,575 Marks, a significant cut when compared to the 22,300 Marks that had been asked four years earlier for the then newly introduced Type M, although it should be borne in mind that there was more general price deflation recorded in the German economy between 1928 and 1932.
The Type R was much more efficient and less expensive than its predecessor, but it still found few buyers. 145 were eventually produced.   Audi could not survive on these volumes and was running out of cash; purchase of the Audi business by Jørgen Skafte Rasmussen in 1928 came as a timely rescue."
33334936.0,0,Audi Type SS,"The Audi Type SS was a large, eight-cylinder-powered sedan/saloon car introduced by Audi in 1929 in succession to the Type R ""Imperator"".
Jørgen Skafte Rasmussen, the Danish-born entrepreneurial industrialist who had purchased Audi-Werke in 1928, had previously, in 1927, purchased the manufacturing plant of the bankrupt Detroit-based Rickenbacker business and shipped it home to Germany.  He installed it in a factory he owned just outside Zschopau, near to Audi's own Zwickau plant.  The plan was to build large, relatively inexpensive US-style ""Rasmussen engines"" for sales to other German auto-makers.  The plan failed in that Rasmussen failed to secure any orders for the engines, so he instead produced a couple of models of his own which used them.   The Audi Type SS (Zwickau) was one of these.The 5,130 cc straight 8 engine developed a maximum output 100 PS (74 kW; 99 hp) at 3,000 rpm, which was relayed using a four-speed transmission through to the rear wheels and converted into a claimed top speed of 110 km/h (68 mph).The car had two leaf-sprung solid axles and hydraulically controlled brakes which operated on all four wheels.

He installed it in a factory he owned just outside Zschopau, near to Audi's own Zwickau plant. The plan was to build large, relatively inexpensive US-style engines for sales to other German auto-makers. The plan failed in that Rasmussen failed to secure any orders for the engines, so he instead produced two models of his own which used engines produced using the Rickenbacker plant. The Audi Type T (Zwickau) was the second and smaller of these.The vehicle had a six-cylinder engine with 3,838 cc of displacement. It developed a maximum output of 75 PS (55 kW; 74 hp) at 3,200 rpm, which was conveyed to the rear wheel through a four-speed manual transmission controlled using a central floor-mounted lever.The car had two leaf-sprung solid axles and four-wheel hydraulic brakes.

Work had begun on the design of the BMW 003 before its contemporary, the Jumo 004, but prolonged developmental problems meant that the BMW 003 entered production much later, and the aircraft projects that had been designed with it in mind were re-engined with the Jumo powerplant instead. The most famous case of this was the Messerschmitt Me 262, which used the 003 in two of the V-series prototypes and in the two experimental A-1b aircraft. The only production aircraft to use the BMW 003 were the Heinkel He 162 and the later C-series, four-engined versions of the Arado Ar 234.
About 3500 BMW 003 engines were built in Germany, but very few were ever installed in aircraft. The engine also formed the basis for turbojet development in Japan during the war, and in the Soviet Union following the war.

The suspension, which was carried over from the 329, consisted of an independent front suspension with a high-mounted transverse leaf spring acting as upper control arms and a conventional live axle on semi-elliptic springs at the rear. It had a slightly greater displacement 6-cylinder engine. It was available as a two-door sedan or two-door convertible and stayed until 1938. The BMW 320 was smaller, less expensive, and lighter than its predecessor. It offered easy handling, a fine finish, and a good power-to-weight ratio.The 320 was replaced by the BMW 321 in 1938."

Five-door 340 station wagons were also manufactured.   It was described in 1948 as the first new car model produced in Germany after the war:  despite new body panels, under the skin it was a modified version of the BMW 326 with which it shared its engine and wheelbase, and which had originally been commercialised in 1936. The 326 had nevertheless been an innovative and well regarded product and the 340, which incorporated several improvements, was seen as a desirable car well into the 1950s.   Early years were dogged by disputes centred on ownership of the plant where it was assembled and its manufacturers’ rights to use the BMW name.   The cars later appeared badged as EMW 340s, and it was under this name that 340s continued to be sold until at least 1953.

It was the most produced radial engine of Germany in World War II with more than 61,000 built.
The 801 was originally intended to replace existing radial types in German transport and utility aircraft. At the time, it was widely agreed among European designers that an inline engine was a requirement for high performance designs due to its smaller frontal area and resulting lower drag. Kurt Tank successfully fitted a BMW 801 to a new fighter design he was working on, and as a result the 801 became best known as the power plant for the famous Focke-Wulf Fw 190. The BMW 801 radial also pioneered the use of what would today be designated an engine control unit: its Kommandogerät engine management system took over the operation of several aviation engine management control parameters of the era, allowing proper operation of the engine with just one throttle lever."

289567.0,0,BMW Dixi,"The Dixi was the first car made by BMW.

Dixi was the brand name of cars made by Automobilwerk Eisenach (Eisenach car factory) starting in 1904. In the difficult economic climate of the 1920s the company found it hard to sell its 6/24 and 9/40 models. So the manufacturer decided to enter the small car market, and in 1927 signed a licensing agreement with the Austin Motor Company to build a variant of the Austin 7. A production level of 2000 cars a year was agreed upon, and Dixi paid Austin a royalty on each vehicle produced.
The first 100 cars were supplied by Austin as kits, but by December 1927 the first of the official Dixi-manufactured vehicles, the DA-1 3/15PS were coming off the production line. The DA designation stood for Deutsche Ausführung, meaning German Version; 3/15 indicated the taxation and actual horsepower ratings. Apart from being left-hand drive and using metric fasteners, the car was nearly identical to the Austin. Body styles available were coupé, roadster, tourer, and sedan with a few chassis going to external coachbuilders.  Most cars left the factory as tourers.  
Looking to move into automobile manufacturing, BMW bought the Automobilwerk Eisenach in 1928 and, with it, the rights to build the Dixi car. At first the cars were badged as BMW Dixi but the Dixi name was dropped in 1929 when the DA-1 was replaced by a slightly updated version, the BMW 3/15 DA-2.

The F800R was first introduced when Streetbike freestyle World Champion, Chris Pfeiffer started using the custom bike for his tricks. Pfeiffer first started using a BMW F800S in January 2006, and eventually transformed the S into an R model in order to lighten the weight of the bike and make it more suitable for motorcycle stunt riding.

BMW developed with Rotax a 798 cc (48.7 cu in) parallel-twin engine with a 360 degree firing order. This produced an exhaust note reminiscent of BMW's signature air-cooled boxer twins. However, this firing order required both pistons to move up and down at the same time. To counter the significant inertia produced by the pistons reciprocating, BMW devised a third vestigial connecting rod to a balance weight. The result was a parallel twin with significantly reduced vibration compared with other parallel twin engine designs. The engine was oiled by a dry sump system, and a soft ignition-cut rev limiter engaged at 9,000 rpm. 

The engine was notable for early and powerful onset of torque. Chris Pfeiffer used a modified F800S before moving to his signature F800R, using the low-end power of the engine for stunting. BMW tuned the F800 series engine to run lean, typically with air-fuel ratios in the range of 15:1 to 16:1.
The F800S and ST both used low-maintenance belt drives and single sided swingarms. Bikes equipped with ABS also included a rear-wheel lift detection system.
In some markets, including the United States, the F800S was discontinued after the 2007 model year. The F800S was discontinued across most of the world after the summer of 2010 with only a few Central American and Eastern European countries still stocking the last supplies of the model."

50083390.0,0,BMW R45,"BMW extended its range of horizontally opposed twins in the late 1970s with the introduction of the R45. 
Looking very much like scaled down versions of BMW's larger models, the R45 featured sharper, more modern styling while both weight and overall dimensions were reduced. The Type 247 Engine was used with smaller pistons, carburettors and a different final drive to assist acceleration.
For the German market, the 473cc R45 came with a reduced power output of 27 bhp (to qualify for favorable insurance) while versions sold elsewhere had 35 bhp on tap.
The R45 was primarily targeted at learner drivers and some 28,000 of these were produced.
Tested by Bike magazine in 1979, the R45 recorded a top speed of 95 mph (154 km/h) while returning an overall fuel consumption of 56.2mpg (5.0litres/100 km). 

Few changes were made to these smaller twins before production ceased in 1985.
Today the R45 is popular with custom bike builders and are being converted into Café Racer or Street scramblers due to their compact dimensions.

The chassis was designed by Willy Rampf, Jacky Eeckelaert and Seamus Mullarkey with the powertrain being designed by Heinz Paschen.
The 2006 season was treated as very much a transitional year by the team, so the car's level of competitiveness was a pleasant surprise.  The F1.06 was a contender for points throughout the season, and its form culminated with two podium finishes: one for Heidfeld at the Hungaroring, and the other for Kubica at Monza.
BMW Sauber also developed the car throughout the year, with some sort of improvement available at every race.  The team's innovation even caused controversy: a ""flexible"" rear wing was stiffened early in the season and two vertical pylons in front of the cockpit were banned after an appearance at Magny-Cours.

239002.0,0,BMW in Formula One,"BMW has been involved in Formula One in a number of capacities since the inauguration of the World Drivers' Championship in 1950. The company entered occasional races in the 1950s and 1960s (often under Formula Two regulations), before building the BMW M12/13 inline-four turbocharged engine in the 1980s. This engine was the result of a deal between BMW and Brabham, which resulted in the team's chassis being powered by BMW engines from 1982 until 1987, a period in which Nelson Piquet won the 1983 championship driving a Brabham BT52-BMW. BMW also supplied the M12/13 on a customer basis to the ATS, Arrows, Benetton and Ligier teams during this period, with various degrees of success. In 1988, Brabham temporarily withdrew from the sport and BMW withdrew its official backing from the engines, which were still used by the Arrows team under the Megatron badge. Turbocharged engines were banned by the revised Formula One Technical Regulations for 1989, rendering the M12/13 obsolete.
BMW decided to return to Formula One in the late 1990s by signing an exclusive contract with the Williams team, which needed a new long-term engine supplier after the withdrawal of Renault in 1997. The programme resulted in the creation of a new V10 engine which made its race début in the Williams FW22 in 2000. The following year saw the partnership move from the midfield to challenging for race victories, but the desired championship remained elusive due to the dominance of Michael Schumacher and Ferrari in the first half of the 2000s. By 2005, the relationship between BMW and Williams had deteriorated, and BMW chose to part company and buy the rival Sauber team outright.
The BMW Sauber project lasted from 2006 until 2009, and resulted in a substantial increase in competitiveness for the Swiss former privateer team. Two podium finishes in the first year were followed by a solid third in the Constructors' Championship in 2007 (which became second when McLaren was disqualified). In 2008, Robert Kubica won the team's only race, the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix, and led the Drivers' Championship at one point, but the team chose to focus on development of its 2009 car and slipped back in the standings by the end of the season. The 2009 season was a major disappointment as the F1.09 chassis proved uncompetitive. Combined with the global financial recession and the company's frustration about the limitations of the contemporary technical regulations in developing technology relevant to road cars, BMW chose to withdraw from the sport, selling the team back to its founder, Peter Sauber."
1464818.0,0,BMW in motorsport,"Throughout its history, BMW cars and motorcycles have been successful in a range of motorsport activities. Apart from the factory efforts, many privateer teams enter BMW road cars in touring car racing. BMW also entered cars or provided engines in Formula One, Formula Two and sportscar racing. BMW is currently active in IMSA, the Isle of Man TT, the North West 200, the Superbike World Championship and the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters (German Touring Car Championship).
An outstanding role has been played by the 1,500 cc BMW M10 engine block. The four-cylinder started with modest 75 hp (56 kW) in 1961, became successful in touring cars, developed over 300 hp (224 kW) in 1970s Formula Two, and at the ripe age of a quarter century, produced almost twentyfold its original power in the 1986 turbocharged BMW M12/13/1, producing an outstanding 1400 hp. This engine became wideley regarded as one of the most powerful, if not the most, powerful engine in the history of Formula 1 as well as being the most powerful engine ever built by BMW. As the base of the BMW S14 engine of the original BMW M3, it collected many more wins.
Other impressive displays of engineering involve the production of the BMW S70/2 engine, implemented in the McLaren F1, which set the world record for ""world's fastest production car"" on March 31, 1998. As well as achieving a Guinness

Introduced by German automaker BMW as an option for the 2013 BMW X5 (F15), sDrive uses torque-vectoring and displacement mechanisms that optimise agility and efficiency. Today, sDrive is available on all of BMW's utility vehicles, from the X1 through X7.
Prior to the introduction of sDrive, the majority of monocoque SUVs came with all-wheel drive, four-wheel drive, or front-wheel drive. The two-wheel drive systems present at the time were generally purpose-built for car applications in terms of handling and durability. Rear-wheel drive was generally only seen on body-on-frame vehicles such as pickup trucks and large SUVs. Prior to the F15 X5, all BMW SUVs came standard with BMW xDrive, the company's symmetric all-wheel drive system. These vehicles proved popular to general consumers but lacked the drivability and steering preciseness of the company's sedans and sports cars. The development of sDrive took approximately eight years, and the internal architecture primarily took cues from BMW's sedan rear-wheel drive over xDrive. However, the slip differential needed to be built more substantially to enable the torque-vectoring system on heavier vehicles.
Today, sDrive is a popular option on BMW's SUVs. Nearly 35% of all SUVs sold in North America are optioned with sDrive. Many journalists have compared sDrive's agility to be similar to BMW's smaller sedans, particularly in the case of the BMW X3 (G01)."

The first Buick V8 was introduced in 1953, then in 1962, the Buick V6 was introduced for the compact Special model. Buick engines, with few exceptions, have always used overhead valves which the company pioneered in the 1904 Buick Model B.
In 2017, Buick sold more than 1.4 million vehicles worldwide, a record for the brand. The main market is now China, where 80% of Buick-branded automobiles are sold. Buicks are also sold in the United States, Canada, and Mexico."

The approach was modeled after the Chevrolet Assembly Division where cars were assembled from knock down kits originating from Flint Assembly and a collection of sites Chevrolet used before the company became a part of General Motors in 1917.
The terminology is confusing because most plants assembled more than just Chevrolet or B-O-P, and refers to the management structure only. The five brands originated vehicles from their respective ""home"" plants, where vehicles were assembled locally for their respective regions. Vehicles were also produced in ""knock-down"" kits and sent to the branch assembly locations. The ""home"" branches were Flint, Michigan for both Buick and Chevrolet; Oldsmobile at Lansing, Michigan; Pontiac at Pontiac, Michigan; and Cadillac at Detroit, Michigan.Plants operating under Chevrolet Assembly management prior to General Motors Assembly Division management (most established pre-1920) were located at St. Louis, Missouri; Janesville, Wisconsin; Buffalo, New York; Norwood, Ohio; Flint (#2), Michigan; Oakland, California; Tarrytown, New York; Lakewood, Georgia; Leeds, Missouri; Baltimore, Maryland; Los Angeles (Van Nuys), California; Ypsilanti (Willow Run), Michigan; and Lordstown, Ohio. Framingham, Massachusetts is unusual in that it changed from B-O-P to Chevy management prior to becoming GMAD.

1868094.0,0,Buick City,"Buick City was a name applied to the former Buick home plant following major renovations completed during the early 1980's to better compete with Japanese producers. The plant was a massive automobile manufacturing complex in the northeast of Flint, Michigan. Elements of the 235-acre (950,000 m2) complex dated from before 1904, when it was known as Flint Wagon Works. Once General Motors assumed operations all aspects of Buick vehicles were constructed, and it became known as Buick City in 1985. The engine block and cylinder heads were cast at Defiance Foundry in Defiance, Ohio and earlier at Saginaw Metal Casting Operations in Saginaw, Michigan.
The original factory at one time was the largest in the world, consisting of 24 separate buildings contributing to the manufacturing process, until 1928 when the Ford River Rouge Complex was completed and began operations. In the beginning, all components were manufactured in one location, to include wheel bearings, nuts, bolts, and screws, to transmissions, suspension components, wheels and interior components. Operations were carried out in this fashion well into the 1940s and beyond.
Operations ceased completely in 2010. The site was vacated by GM employees and site responsibilities were transferred to Motors Liquidation Company as of December 6, 2010. The final cars built at Buick City were the Pontiac Bonneville and the Buick LeSabre. Manufacturing operations were transferred to Orion Assembly.
The plant originated with Buick before the formation of General Motors. Other elements were built by early manufacturers and suppliers like Fisher Body. For more than 80 years, it was Buick's ""home plant"" and built the majority of models in the line up. After World War II, when vehicle production resumed, Buick City was the primary location where all components were created, with knock-down kits distributed to assembly plants in major metropolitan US cities, where the vehicles were locally assembled and distributed in their respective regions.
The Buick City concept represented a successful attempt by General Motors to experiment with just-in-time manufacturing methods in response to Japanese manufacturers. The experiment included successes: The 1989 Buick LeSabre built in Buick City was ranked the top car in the J.D. Power and Associates rankings for that year; it was the first American built car to appear on the list.
General Motors announced in 1997 that the plant would close, as production of the next generation of full sized GM cars would be consolidated at Orion Assembly. In 1999, the year the plant was closed, Buick City won J. D. Power's Platinum Award for assembly plant quality. The plant closed on June 29, 1999. As of 2016, it is the only General Motors plant to win the award.
The closing of GM's manufacturing plants in Flint, and its subsequent economic toll on the community was chronicled in Michael Moore's 1989 documentary film, Roger & Me.
The plant's acreage became an EPA cleanup site.In 2013, American Cast Iron Pipe Company announced plans to construct a new 200,000 square foot manufacturing plant on the former Buick City complex.On August 11, 2017, a 156,000-square-foot Lear Corporation seat manufacturing facility situated on 33 acres at the former Buick City site in Flint."

The Chevrolet Cruze is based on this same platform.
Since the 2009 economic crises and the subsequent demise of the Saturn brand and reduction of GM's North American brands to four, the Opel models are aligned no longer with the Saturn brand, but the Buick brand.

Previously, the company manufactured the Buick Six that used the overhead valve six-cylinder 242 cu in (4.0 L) engine in their high-end cars, and the Buick Four for smaller, less-expensive cars. Starting with 1918, they dropped the four-cylinder engine and designed a small six, which they called the Buick Standard Six, to replace that end of the market. They coined the name ""Master Six"" for the high-end cars, now powered by the  255 cu in (4.2 L) engine released the year before. The yearly changes were a result of a new business philosophy called planned obsolescence"

A model B was exhibited in 1905 at the New York Auto Show as a promotion of the model C which would be the same. William C. Durant introduced the car himself at the exhibit, and took new car orders at the car show, raising sales from 37 cars in 1904 to 750 in 1905. It had a 2-cylinder, horizontally opposed engine – the world's first production OHV (overhead valve) engine – installed lengthwise within the frame, had a planetary transmission, with a cone clutch and two forward speeds and one reverse gear. The engine was rated at 21 bhp. In later years, it was renamed as improvements were made. The chassis was shared later with the Oldsmobile Model 20 when they became a division of GM while the overhead valve engine wasn't used by Oldsmobile. It had a retail price of US$950 ($27,364 in 2020 dollars ) for the touring sedan.
The Model B / C continued to be made, as model F, G, and 14, but was dropped after 1911 as Buick had been promoting 4 cylinder cars, starting with the D in 1907.

3934115.0,0,Buick Open,"The Buick Open was a PGA Tour golf tournament from 1958 to 2009. In 2007, the tournament was held at the end of June, a change from its traditional spot between The Open Championship and the PGA Championship. Regardless, many prominent players used it as a ""tune-up"" for the subsequent major.
For the event's first decade, the Buick Open Invitational was played at Warwick Hills Golf and Country Club in Grand Blanc, Michigan. After 1969, professional golf events in the area fell off the PGA Tour schedule and a series of pro-ams and other similarly unofficial events took place, mostly at Flint Golf Club in Flint, Michigan.
Flint native, and PGA touring professional Larry Mancour had returned to Michigan to play in the Buick Open and stayed to build the Grand Blanc Golf Club.  He then added nine holes at the Flint Elks Golf Club where he remained the professional for 20 years. He rescued the Buick Open when General Motors dropped sponsorship of the tournament. With local Buick dealers Mancour started the Little Buick Open in 1969. It drew players and fans and led to the rebirth of the Buick Open in 1977.
The Buick Open officially made its return to the PGA Tour in 1977 at the Flint Elks Club, and in 1978 the event returned to Warwick Hills G&CC, where it remained until its demise.
The Associated Press reported July 28, 2009 that General Motors would end its sponsorship of the Buick Open after the 2009 tournament, in order to devote its marketing resources to cars and trucks. The PGA Tour replaced the tournament with the Greenbrier Classic at The Greenbrier in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.As in the 1970s, a series of pro-ams and other unofficial events now take place in Grand Blanc, with the AJGA's Randy Wise Open taking place at Warwick Hills and most pro-ams and a golf festival at the Jewel of Grand Blanc (the former Grand Blanc Golf Club).
In 2014, an unrelated tournament with the same name was started in China. The event is played on PGA Tour China.
In 2018, the former General Motors financing arm, now Ally Bank, returned to Warwick Hills to sponsor a PGA Tour Champions event, The Ally Challenge.  Jim Furyk is the only player to have won both, winning the 2003 Buick Open, and the 2020 Ally Challenge, which also was the Champions' return after the pandemic, winning in his first tournament.

Unlike its subsequent GM E platform stablemates, the Oldsmobile Toronado and Cadillac Eldorado, the Riviera was initially a front engine/rear-wheel drive platform, switching to front-wheel drive starting with the 1979 model year.
While the early models stayed close to their original form, eight subsequent generations varied substantially in size and styling. A total of 1,127,261 Rivieras were produced.

They were OHV, like their previous engines, as Buick had been almost exclusively using overhead valve engines since the Model B in 1904. The engine also had the starter and generator in a single unit. The first six cylinders engine was cast in pairs (3x2 cylinders). The 224 and 242 CID did not have a removable cylinder head, meaning the cylinders and valves came off as a unit, (although with the valves in cages, the cages were removable individually), and pistons had to come out of the bottom of the unit as it was removed. This was colloquially called a ""jughead"" engine, since the jugs (cylinders) came off with the head. Since 1924, all engines had a removable head. They had a displacement ranging from 191 to 331 cu in (3.1 to 5.4 L) depending on year and model. In 1925 the series was divided into the lower priced Buick Standard Six and the high-end Buick Master Six series. The Buick Straight-8 engine replaced the straight 6 across the board in all models, in 1931, and was the basis of the Holden straight-six motor.

The Super prioritized passenger comfort over engine performance and was replaced by the Riviera in 1963. For several years, it was called the ""Buick Eight"" or ""Super Eight"" due to the engravement on the grille while all Buick's since 1931 were all installed with the Buick Straight-8 engine with varying engine displacement.

1044611.0,0,Buick Terraza,"The Buick Terraza is a luxury minivan that was marketed by Buick from 2005 through 2007 model years. The Terraza was a badge engineered variant of the Chevrolet, Pontiac, and Saturn minivans sharing the U platform; (Uplander, Montana SV6, and Relay respectively) in Doraville, Georgia.
The Terraza retailed at US$28,110 in 2005. The Buick debuted with one engine, a 3.5 L High Value V6 that generates 200 hp (149 kW) and 220 lb·ft (298 N·m) of torque, going from 0-60 mph in the 9-second range. For 2006, a 3.9 L LZ9 V6, with 240 hp (179 kW) and 240 lb·ft (332 Nm) torque. It offered leather seats, and a wood trim on the panels and also offered on the steering wheel and gear shift knob.
For 2007, the 3.5 L V6 was dropped, leaving the 3.9 L as the base engine. Consequently, the optional AWD system was also dropped, since it could not handle the torque of the 3.9 L engine. A flex-fuel version of the 3.9 L V6 also became available for the Terraza's third season.

895662.0,0,Buick V6 engine,"The Buick V6, popularly referred to as the 3800 in its later incarnations, originally 198 cu in (3.2 L) and initially marketed as Fireball at its introduction in 1962, was a large V6 engine used by General Motors. The block is made of cast iron and all use two-valve-per-cylinder iron heads, actuated by pushrods. The engine, originally designed and manufactured in the United States, was also produced in later versions in Australia. It was the first six-cylinder engine designed exclusively for Buick products since the Buick straight-six was discontinued in 1930.
The 3800 was on the Ward's 10 Best Engines of the 20th century list, made Ward's yearly 10 Best list multiple times, and is one of the most-produced engines in history. To date, over 25 million have been produced.
In 1967, GM sold the design to Kaiser-Jeep. The muscle car era had taken hold, and GM no longer felt the need to produce a V6, considered an unusual engine configuration in North America at the time. The energy crisis a decade later prompted the company to buy the design back from American Motors (AMC), who had by that point bought Kaiser-Jeep, and the descendants of the early 231 continue to be the most-common GM V6 as it developed into a very durable and reliable design.
Though the pre-3800 rear-wheel drive (RWD) V6 uses the Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac (BOP) bellhousing pattern, an oddity of both the front-wheel drive (FWD) and RWD 3800 V6 is that although it is a 90° V6, it uses the GM 60° V6 bell housing (Metric Pattern). For use in the FWD applications, the bellhousings on the FWD transmissions are altered slightly.
This engine has the cylinders numbered 1-3-5 on the left-hand bank (front bank for FWD applications) and 2-4-6 on the right-hand bank, the number 1 cylinder being the furthest from the flywheel end. The firing order is 1-6-5-4-3-2.
The engine was produced at the Flint North plant in Flint, Michigan, with engine blocks and cylinder heads cast at the Grey Iron plant (now the GM Saginaw Metal Casting Operations plant) at 1629 N. Washington Avenue in Saginaw, Michigan.
It is a derivative of Buick's 215 cu in (3.5 L) aluminium V8 family, which also went on to become the Rover V8, another engine with a very long life (1960–2006)"

All are naturally aspirated OHV pushrod engines, except for an optional turbocharged version of the short-lived 215 used in the 1962-63 Oldsmobile Cutlass.
Six displacements of the engine were used in two generations between 1953 and 1966, varying from 264 cu in (4.3 L) to 425 cu in (7.0 L); three displacements of standard cast-iron small blocks between 1964 and 1981, and 300 cu in (4.9 L) and 350 cu in (5.7 L); one of the 215 cu in (3.5 L) aluminum blocks (1961-1963); and three big blocks between 1967 and 1976 and 400 cu in (6.6 L) and 455 cu in (7.5 L).

Ramírez left the group, unhappy with decisions made by their record company, and Pepe Marchante came in as bassist.

In 1986, Cadillac were chosen by broadcaster Televisión Española as the Spanish representatives for the 31st Eurovision Song Contest with the Guzmán-composed song ""Valentino"".

Each model year added the year prefix to the series (37-60 and 38-60) in the number hierarchy used at the time. It was replaced by the Series 39-61 in 1939, but a model that was derived from it, the Sixty Special or 60S, continued off and on through 1993.
The Series 60 was the brainchild of new Cadillac manager, Nicholas Dreystadt. Debuting in 1936, it filled a gaping price gap between the updated appearance of the successful LaSalles of which the Series 60 was the upgraded version with the ""Cadillac"" name, and the Series 36-70 Cadillac models. Initially it rode on a 121.0 in (3,073 mm) wheelbase and shared the B body with cars from LaSalle, Buick, and Oldsmobile. This went up to 124.0 in (3,150 mm) in 1937–1938.The exterior featured a new Harley Earl–designed look with a tall, slender grille and split vee-shaped windshield. This body used Fisher Body's new Turret Top one-piece roof and Bendix dual-servo brakes. ""Knee-Action"" independent suspension, first introduced by Cadillac in 1934, was a welcome novelty for the mid-price market at the time.Under the hood was the new (less expensive) Monobloc V8. This 322 cu in (5.3 L) engine produced 125 hp (93 kW), just 10 less than that in the larger Cadillacs. The Series 60 immediately became the company's best-selling model, making up half of all Cadillacs sold the first year.The next year, displacement on all Monobloc Cadillacs was 346 cu in (5.7 L).

While production was suspended from model years 1943–1945 due to World War II, it remained as the junior level product line until 1951. The size, equipment list and quality level were the most popular with buyers who wanted a prestigious luxury car that was usually driven by the owner, while the longer cars were chauffeur driven.

It was slightly higher in status than the LaSalle, also offered by Cadillac.
In 1937 it was offered in only one body style, a 4-door 5-seat sedan, built by Fisher on the same  131.0 in (3,327 mm) wheelbase as used by the Cadillac Series 70 and the Buick Roadmaster.  The car offered a longer heavier car than the Series 60 at a price below that of the Fleetwood bodied Series 70.Under the hood was the Monobloc V8.

The vehicle is equipped with a Cadillac proprietary-developed aluminum 32-valve V16 engine displacing 13.6 liters (829 cu. in; 13,584 cc), which was exclusive to the Sixteen and based on the GM Generation IV LS architecture. It is mated to a four-speed, electronically controlled, automatic transmission driving the rear wheels. The engine features fuel-saving Active Fuel Management ""Displacement on Demand"" technology, which could shut down either twelve or eight of the cylinders when the full output was not needed.  The V16 was capable of 16.65 mpg under normal conditions. The engine was said to produce a minimum of 1,000 bhp (746 kW; 1,014 PS) and at least 1,000 lb⋅ft (1,356 N⋅m) of torque using no form of forced induction. The car itself weighs about 5,005 lb (2,270 kg).

The car referenced the Cadillac V-16 of the 1930s. The actual design of the car was a combination of Cadillac's current ""Art and Science"" design theme and 1967 Cadillac Eldorado cues. Additional original design elements were provided by an in-house design competition led by GM Vice President Bob Lutz.  The Sixteen has the Cadillac logo carved out of solid crystal on the steering wheel and a Bulgari clock on the dashboard.
Although the Sixteen remained a concept car, its design language was implemented in Cadillac's subsequent vehicles, most noticeably on the 2008 Cadillac CTS. Since its unveiling there have been resurfacing rumors about a possible very limited production of an exclusive Cadillac halo model. A scaled-down version of the car, referred to as the ULS (Ultra Luxury Sedan) or XLS, with a standard V8 and an optional V12 (the latter was to be called the Cadillac Twelve), had been rumored for production since 2005, but was eventually shelved in favor of the Cadillac XTS.
Ever since the Sixteen was first unveiled there have been resurfacing rumors, speculation and high hopes of automotive journalists and aficionados about a possible limited production of an exclusive Cadillac halo model, such as the Sixteen, to be the ""ultimate flagship"" of the brand and sit atop of the upcoming flagship, as previewed by the Ciel concept of late 2011. An exclusive Cadillac halo model descended from the Sixteen concept lineage was finally confirmed in March 2020 with the Cadillac Celestiq, an ultra luxury, 4 door electric flagship sedan set to begin production in 2023.

3283868.0,0,Cadillac Type 51,"The Cadillac V8, introduced as the Type 51, is a large, luxurious automobile that was introduced in September 1914 by Cadillac as a 1915 model. It was Cadillac's first V8 automobile, replacing the four-cylinder Model 30, and used the all new GM A platform for the entire series shared with all GM division brands using a 122 in (3,099 mm) wheelbase, while a 145 in (3,683 mm) chassis was offered separately to be used for custom coachwork. The Types 53, 55, 57, 59, and 61 were introduced every year through 1923 with yearly improvements until an all new platform was substantially updated and introduced as the V-63 using the business philosophy called planned obsolescence.  It was built at the Cass Street and Amsterdam Avenue factory in Detroit, with the coachwork provided by Fisher Body. The chassis could be purchased separately and sent to the clients choice of coachbuilder optionally.When GM decided to enter Cadillac as their top level luxury car as an alternative to luxury brands already established, it was a competitor to the all-new Packard Twin Six. The most expensive coachwork option offered from Cadillac for 1915 was the Berline Limousine at US$3,600 ($92,096 in 2020 dollars ).
All of these models used a new L-head V8 engine, one of the first V8 engines ever mass-produced and a substantial differentiator for the marque.  All bodies were built by Fisher.  The Type 51 was also the first left-hand drive Cadillac—all previous models had been right-hand drive, which was continued as an option.  Wheelbases varied in those years, with 122 in (3099 mm) at the low end and 145 in (3683 mm) as the longest.The 1916 Type 53 was the first car to use the same control layout as modern automobiles- with the gear lever and hand brake in the middle of the front two seats, a key started ignition, and three pedals for the clutch, brake and throttle in the modern order. This Cadillac was driven by a 77 horsepower V8 engine. The Type 53 designation was used one year only, then each year the designation number would update for each model year. Nine body styles were offered, and for the first time, from 1916 until 1919, Cadillac offered three commercial use platforms, described as Police Patrol (US$2,955), Ambulance (US$3,455) and Hearse (US$3,880) ($92,278 in 2020 dollars ).The 1917 Type 55 was introduced with appearance changes, and cast aluminum is used when constructing the 2-door, 4-passenger Coupe. The choice of available body styles increases to 12, including the commercial versions. The Berline coach choice is renamed Imperial due to WWI as Cadillac didn't want to associate its products with Imperial Germany. This was also the year that cross town rival Lincoln offered a V8 luxury sedan and several different coachwork choices, while the introduction of the Packard Twin Six appeared in 1916.
For model year 1918, Cadillac offered a new coachwork option called the Type 57 Suburban which could accommodate seven passengers with a 132 in (3,353 mm) wheelbase, and was the first time GM used that description for one of their products with a retail price of US$4,090 ($70,372 in 2020 dollars ). A new commercial coach choice labeled US Government Limousine was offered in addition to the ambulance, police patrol and hearse, and the cylinder heads on the V8 engine were now detachable for maintenance .The 1919 Type 57 again saw minor appearance changes and body styles offered, while removing the landaulet, town landaulet and hearse and adding the Imperial Suburban with a 132 in (3,353 mm) wheelbase and renaming the Town Limousine as Town Brougham. The Victoria Coupe was no longer a convertible and used aluminum in the roof construction. Body types were now identified as either 57-A or 57-B while this wasn't a Type designation for the vehicle affected.Model years 1920 and 1921 were essentially combined due to the postwar economy, material shortages, and the Great Railroad Strike of 1922, while Cadillac was in transition from the Cass Street Factory to the new Detroit Assembly factory nearing completion on Clark Street. Fisher Body continued the tradition of making minor appearance, equipment and feature changes, changing the angle of the windshield, or positioning of exterior lighting elements. Body style changes were now documented as First, Second and Third design and choices were now reduced to 10. The previous Type 57 had earned a favorable reputation with its deployment during the war, and orders for the latest model contributed to long waiting lists. The top level Imperial Limousine was now listed at US$5190 ($75,303 in 2020 dollars ). A new manufacturer entered the competition, focusing on engineering excellence called Duesenberg and offered a few body styles that were premium priced in 1921.
The Type 61 was the last vehicle built at the Cass Street Factory, and due to various contributing factors carried over from the previous Type 59, was manufactured for model years 1922 and 1923. As before, there were various appearance, equipment, standard and optional feature changes to include an extendable trunk rack on the rear of the most body styles, runningboard kick plates on five-passenger sedan and phaeton, along with the inclusion of nickel-plated exterior lights and radiator shell offered. The diameter of the wheels was reduced to lower the center of gravity, while the 132 in (3,353 mm) wheelbase was the only choice. Body style continued to be documented as First, Second and Third Design, and 41,001 vehicles were produced. For the first time, the prices were reduced across all models following an automobile industry trend due to increased production schedules, improved manufacturing efficiency and economic pressures. The top level Landaulet Sedan was US$5290 ($81,790 in 2020 dollars ) while the Imperial Limousine was US$4950 ($76,533 in 2020 dollars )."

It retained the name Cadillac V8 introduced with the previous generation Cadillac Type 51.The V-63 used an improved version of the L-head V8 engine that made Cadillac famous.  The main innovation was a cross-plane crankshaft which improved balance and smoothness.  This design required complex mathematical analysis, and was simultaneously patented by Peerless.  Both companies agreed to share the innovation, which became a market distinction being able to exclusively offer a V8. For model year 1924, the Packard Eight straight-eight was now a competitor due to its reduced vibration. The body style choices were expanded to 14 while commercial applications weren't offered. New innovations included the availability of Balloon tires mounted on either wire wheels or steel pressed discs, while wooden wheels made of hickory were standard equipment along with the availability of front-wheel brakes.The most noticeable update for 1925 was the introduction of two classifications of body style choices. The ""Standard"" bodies was added for 1925 that offered a five passenger Brougham, two passenger Coupe, four passenger Victoria, a five- and seven passenger Sedan and a seven passenger Imperial limousine. A higher content ""Custom"" body styles offered a Roadster, Touring Car, Phaeton, five passenger Coupe and Sedan, seven passenger Suburban with the top level seven passenger Imperial limousine, while the mechanicals and chassis were otherwise largely unchanged.

The V series was initially created as part of the 2000s Cadillac rebranding and the new 'Art & Science' design language to compete directly with German rivals such as BMW M and Mercedes-AMG. The first-ever V series model was the 2004 Cadillac CTS-V which became a successful seller and steered Cadillac in the new direction for the following decade.
The letter ""V"" was chosen as a salute to post-WWII Cadillacs that featured a V-shape ornament below the crowned wreath logo, the shape itself was never recognized as a letter back then. Most V series Cadillac cars traditionally include high-performance V8 engines, transmissions, revised suspension systems (MagneRide Control), revised interiors, aerodynamics, and more aggressive bodywork which is intended to improve vehicles aerodynamic performance as well as differentiate them from their normal production counterparts.
Cadillac has also re-entered motorsport competition with their CTS-V.R, a joint venture between GM Performance Division and Pratt & Miller race team, most famous for their role in GM's Le Mans-winning Corvette C5.R program.
In 2009, the second-generation CTS-V sedan achieved a lap time of 7:59.32 at the Nürburgring Nordschleife, which was the fastest documented time for a production sedan on factory tires—until the Porsche Panamera Turbo clocked a time of 7:56 in July 2009—thanks to a heavily-tuned ""LS9"" EATON-supercharged 6.2-liter (380 in3) V8 engine that was borrowed from Corvette.

24698962.0,0,Cadillac insurance plan,"Informally, a Cadillac plan is any unusually expensive health insurance plan, usually arising in discussions of medical-cost control measures in the United States. The term derives from the Cadillac automobile, which has represented American luxury goods since its introduction in 1902, and as a health care metaphor dates to the 1970s. The term gained popularity in the early 1990s during the debate over the Clinton health care plan of 1993, and was also widespread during debate over possible excise taxes on ""Cadillac"" plans during the health care reforms proposed during the Obama administration. (Bills proposed by Clinton and Obama did not use the term ""Cadillac"".)
A study published in Health Affairs in December 2009 found that high-cost health plans do not provide unusually rich benefits to enrollees. The researchers found that 3.7% of the variation in the cost of family coverage in employer-sponsored health plans is attributable to differences in the actuarial value of benefits. 6.1% Of the variation is attributable to the combination of benefit design and plan type (e.g., PPO, HMO, etc.). The employer's industry and regional variations in health care costs explain part of the variation. The researchers conclude ""…that analysts should not equate high-cost plans with Cadillac plans, but that in fact other factors—industry and cost of medical inputs—are as important in predicting whether a plan is a high-cost plan. Without appropriate adjustments, a simple cap may exacerbate rather than ameliorate current inequities.""The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010), imposes an annual 40% excise tax on plans with annual premiums exceeding $10,800 for individuals or $29,500 for a family starting in 2020, to be paid by insurers.  The tax was originally set to take effect in 2018.  However, in December 2015, a law delayed the start date to 2020.  In January 2018, the implementation was postponed until 2022. In December 2019, it was repealed entirely.The tax is not imposed on the total cost of the plan, but on the costs exceeding the aforementioned values, which, after 2020, will adjust to inflation annually. These costs include any part of a person's income allocated to flexible spending accounts, health reimbursement accounts, and health savings accounts, but not expenditures for stand-alone dental, vision, accident, disability, or long-term care insurance coverage. After the December 2015 changes, the tax is now a deductible business expense, reducing the impact on businesses that pay income tax. The tax is intended to do three things: help finance the PPACA; reduce overall health care costs; and address the unequal tax benefit of excluding employer-based health insurance coverage from taxes.Although the tax plan was positioned to combat a ""luxury"", it will affect more employees over time. The threshold is initially indexed to Consumer Price Index (CPI), plus 1 percentage point.  Starting in 2021, it is indexed to unmodified CPI.  However, medical inflation is higher than general inflation.  This means as healthcare costs rise, more employees' plans will be subjected to the tax.  It also will impact, possibly eliminate, some healthcare savings accounts, which are included in the plan cost calculation. A study from the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated 26 percent of all employers would face the tax in at least one of their plans in 2018, when the tax was then scheduled to be implemented. Labor unions have also opposed this tax because it would be ""very disruptive"" to their healthcare plans and have asked that their members be eligible for the same federal subsidies available to low-income workers in the new health exchanges."

There are four sodium-filled valves per cylinder.
The intercooled turbochargers are mounted between the cylinder banks in a so-called hot-V configuration and their twin scroll design broadens their performance capability, offering quicker response and greater efficiency. These produce up to 20 psi (1.4 bar) and are matched with electronic wastegate control for more precise boost management and more responsive torque production. Ninety percent of the engine's peak torque is available at 2000 rpm and carried through 5200 rpm.
Other features include direct fuel injection  camshaft phasing, variable displacement/start-stop cylinder deactivation, and variable-pressure oiling system with piston-cooling oil jets.
All versions were to come equipped with the Ford 10L90 10-speed automatic transmission and Cadillac's all-wheel drive system.In spite of its power and sophistication, high cost to produce the engine and low demand for the CT6-V led to its cancellation in early 2020, before it could be expanded to Cadillac's Escalade line."

It took its name by shortening the production series number 2100 by one digit in order to capitalize on the 1950s trend toward numerical auto names.  The numerical designation ""210"" was also sporadically used in company literature. It replaced the Styleline DeLuxe model available in previous years. The 210 was discontinued after the 1957 model year to be replaced by the Biscayne."
879643.0,0,Chevrolet 2300 engine,"The 2300 is a 2.3 L; 139.6 cu in (2,287 cc) inline-four engine produced by the Chevrolet division of General Motors for the 1971 to 1977 model years of the Chevrolet Vega and Chevrolet Monza. It featured a die-cast aluminum alloy cylinder block. The high-tech block features an alloy with 17 percent silicon. During the machining process, the cylinders were etched leaving the pure silicon particles exposed providing the piston wear surface, eliminating the need for iron cylinder liners. The block has cast iron main caps and a cast iron crankshaft. The engine's cylinder head is cast iron  for lower cost, structural integrity and longer camshaft bearing life. The valvetrain features a direct-acting single overhead camshaft design. The engine block and cylinder heads were cast at Massena Castings Plant in Massena, New York.

44311783.0,0,Chevrolet AK Series,"The Chevrolet AK Series truck was a light duty truck sold under the Chevrolet brand, with production beginning in 1941 until 1947. It used the GM A platform, shared with the Chevrolet Deluxe. The AK series was also branded and sold at GMC locations, with the primary visual difference being the Chevrolet had vertical bars in the grille, while the GMC had horizontal bars. The 1941-45 GMC models were sold as C-Series and became the E-Series for the 1946 and 1947 model years (CC-Series / EC-Series for the conventional cab models and CF-Series / EF-Series for the COE ones).The AK series represented an appearance split from previous Chevrolet products where the passenger cars and pickup trucks shared a common appearance, as demonstrated in the Chevrolet Master truck. The Chevrolet Deluxe was an all-new appearance when it was introduced in 1941, and shared much of its mechanicals with the third generation Chevrolet Suburban. The truck is considered the second real truck produced by General Motors since trucks preceding the Master trucks were completely car-based, and thus coupe utilities.
It was replaced with the Advance-Design, that was also sold as a GMC.

15575128.0,0,Chevrolet Advance Design,"The Advance-Design is a light and medium duty truck series by Chevrolet, their first major redesign after WWII.  Its GMC counterpart was the GMC New Design. It was billed as a larger, stronger, and sleeker design in comparison to the earlier AK Series. First available on Saturday, June 28, 1947, these trucks were sold with various minor changes over the years until March 25, 1955, when the Task Force Series trucks replaced the Advance-Design model.
The same basic design family was used for all of its trucks including the Suburban, panel trucks, canopy express, and cab overs. The cab overs used the same basic cab configuration and similar grille but used a shorter and taller hood and different fenders. The unique cab over fenders and hood required a custom cowl area which makes the cab over engine cabs and normal truck cabs incompatible with one another while all truck cabs of all weights interchange. 
From 1947 until 1955, Chevrolet trucks were number one in sales in the United States, with rebranded versions sold at GMC locations.While General Motors used this front end sheet metal, and to a slightly lesser extent the cab, on all of its trucks except for the cab overs, there are three main sizes of this truck: the half-, three-quarter-, and full-ton capacities in short and long wheelbase."
13073820.0,0,Chevrolet Aerovette,"The Chevrolet Aerovette was a concept car created by Chevrolet, beginning life as Experimental Project 882 (XP-882) in the late 1960s. It had a mid-engine configuration using a transverse mounting of its V8 engine. Zora Arkus-Duntov's engineers originally built two XP-882 prototypes during 1969, but John DeLorean, Chevrolet's general manager, canceled the program believing it to be impractical and costly. However, when Ford announced plans to sell the DeTomaso Pantera through Lincoln-Mercury dealers, DeLorean ordered that one XP-882 prototype be cleaned up for display at the 1970 New York Auto Show.
In 1972, DeLorean authorized further work on the XP-882 chassis and gave it a new project code, XP-895. A near-identical body in aluminum alloy that resembled the XP-895 was constructed, and became the ""Reynolds Aluminum Car."" Two of the Chevrolet Vega 2-rotor engines were joined together as a 4-rotor, 420 hp (313 kW) engine, which was used to power XP-895. The XP-895 was first shown in late 1973. Another Corvette concept, XP-897GT, also appeared in 1973, which used a 2-rotor engine. However, with the energy crisis of the time, GM scrapped its rotary development work and all plans for a Wankel-powered car. The XP-897GT 2-rotor Concept was sold to Tom Falconer and fitted with a Mazda 13B rotary engine in 1997.
In 1976, the 4-rotor engine was replaced by a 400 cu in (6,600 cc) Chevrolet V8, and the concept car was named Aerovette and approved for production for 1980. The Aerovette featured double folding gullwing doors. The production car would use a 350 cu in (5,700 cc) V8, and be priced between $15,000-$18,000. However, after chief supporters Duntov, Bill Mitchell, and Ed Cole had retired from General Motors, David R. McLellan decided that a front/mid-engine car would be more economical to build and would have better performance, and canceled the Aerovette program entirely. Contemporary imported rear mid-engine cars had poor sales in the United States compared to the front-engined Datsun 240Z, which ultimately determined the Aerovette's fate, further contributing to termination of production plans."

The three versions included two forced induction inline-four Ecotec engines and a third naturally aspirated engine that was later called the Cobalt Sport. SS is an abbreviation of Super Sport, a historic moniker used by Chevrolet to denote high performance upgrades that meet certain criteria.
The Cobalt SS was GM's first foray into the tuner market, launching as a 205 hp (153 kW; 208 PS) supercharged 2.0 L coupe in late 2004, paired only with the F35 5-speed manual transmission of Opel. The following year, a naturally aspirated 1SS model equipped with GM's new 2.4 L 171 hp (128 kW; 173 PS) engine was added in both coupe and sedan body styles, including automatic and manual transmission options. Production of the supercharged coupe continued until 2007, and after a brief hiatus the SS relaunched in the second quarter of 2008 with a more efficient and powerful turbocharged 2.0 L engine producing 260 hp (194 kW; 264 PS) before all Cobalt production ended in 2010. (See timeline).
The Cobalt SS received generally positive reviews, particularly the turbocharged and supercharged versions. In a 2013 review, journalist Patrick George called it the best compact car ever made by General Motors, and a potential ""future classic"". At first release in 2004, the supercharged version was praised for its performance but drew criticism for its interior quality and exterior styling, both described as too reminiscent of its predecessor, the Cavalier. Reports surfaced in May 2009 that General Motors planned to eliminate the Cobalt SS as early as December 2009, but they proved to be untrue. Production continued but ordering options for late 2010 models were limited and production of all Cobalts ended in June 2009. The car was replaced by the Cruze, but a high performance version comparable to the Cobalt SS was never built and the Cruze ended production for the North American market in 2019."

In appearance, and technical respects it resembled the Volkswagen Type 3 Squareback, but power came from the Corvair's rear-mounted Chevrolet Turbo-Air 6 engine with 146 cu.in. displacement which developed 80 bhp (60 kW) at 4,400 rpm.

Introduced for the 1970 model year, the model line was produced across six generations through the 2007 model year, with a hiatus from 1989-1994. The Monte Carlo was a closely aligned variant of the Pontiac Grand Prix through its entire production.
From 1970 to 1972, the Monte Carlo used the ""A-Special"" platform with the Grand Prix, shifting to the A-body intermediate chassis for 1973-1977. For 1978, the model line underwent extensive downsizing; a major revision saw the A-body chassis redesignated as the G-body for 1981. After an abbreviated 1988 model year, the Monte Carlo was replaced by the two-door Chevrolet Lumina.
For the 1995 model year, the Monte Carlo was revived, replacing the two-door Lumina. Sharing the front-wheel drive W-platform with the two-door Grand Prix, the Monte Carlo was again slotted above the Camaro as the largest Chevrolet coupe. Following the discontinuation of the four-door Lumina, the Chevrolet Impala became the four-door equivalent of the Monte Carlo. After the 2002 model year, the Grand Prix coupe was discontinued, leaving the Monte Carlo as the largest two-door coupe produced by an American auto manufacturer.
In response to declining sales of the model line, Chevrolet discontinued the Monte Carlo after the 2007 model year; as of current production, the Camaro (reintroduced for 2010) and the Corvette are the sole two-door Chevrolet model lines. During much of its production, the Monte Carlo represented the Chevrolet brand in stock car racing. During the 1980s, the Monte Carlo SS was introduced, featuring aerodynamically-enhanced styling; as part of its revival, the Monte Carlo again represented Chevrolet in stock car racing from 1995 through its discontinuation."

31990527.0,0,Chevrolet Standard Six,"The Chevrolet Standard (Series DC) was launched in 1933, initially as the Chevrolet Standard Mercury, by Chevrolet as a lower priced alternative to the 1932 Chevrolet Series BA Confederate that became the Master Eagle in 1933  and Master from 1934. It was advertised as the cheapest six-cylinder enclosed car on the market.The Standard was offered in three body styles all on a 107-inch wheelbase: 2-door sedan (a body style Chevrolet customarily referred to as a ""coach"" in marketing at the time), coupe and coupe with rumble seat. All bodies were by Fisher and featured 'no-draft ventilation'. All models were powered by a 181 cu in (2,970 cc) six-cylinder valve-in-head engine producing 60 bhp (45 kW; 61 PS) at 3,000 rpm and 125 lb⋅ft (169 N⋅m) of torque giving the car a top speed of between 65–70 mph. This engine had first appeared in Chevrolet's 1929 models, introduced in 1928. The car had full instrumentation. A clock, heater and a radio were options. For 1934, sedan, roadster and touring body styles were added to the catalog.
In 1935, a larger 206.8 cu in (3,389 cc) six-cylinder engine was offered in lieu of the 181 cu in (2,970 cc), producing 74 bhp (55 kW; 75 PS) at 3,200 rpm and 150 lb⋅ft (203 N⋅m) of torque. A sedan delivery was also available this year.
For 1936, the Standard Six received a wide range of improvements and a wider choice of body styles including cabriolet and sports sedan versions. It was built on a new box-girder frame with a wheel base of 109 inches. With an increase of compression ratio from 5.6:1 to 6:1, the standard 206.8 cu in (3,389 cc) engine now produced 79 bhp (59 kW; 80 PS) at 3,200 rpm and 156 lb⋅ft (212 N⋅m) of torque which was now shared with the Master Six. The spare wheel moved from its external rear trunk location to a new compartment under the trunk. Brakes were 11-in drums. The steel roof was new.The Standard Six was discontinued for 1937 when the Master range was joined by the new Master Deluxe. In May of 1925 the Chevrolet Export Boxing plant at Bloomfield, New Jersey was repurposed from a previous owner where Knock-down kits for Chevrolet, Oakland, Oldsmobile, Buick and Cadillac passenger cars, and both Chevrolet and G. M. C. truck parts are crated and shipped by railroad to the docks at Weehawken, New Jersey for overseas GM assembly factories.

947387.0,0,Chevrolet Tahoe,"The Chevrolet Tahoe, and its badge engineered GMC Yukon counterpart, are full-size SUVs from General Motors, offered since 1994 and 1991, respectively. Since 1982, Chevrolet and GMC sold two different-sized SUVs under their 'Blazer' and 'Jimmy' nameplates, by introducing the smaller S-10 Blazer and GMC S-15 Jimmy for the 1983 model year, below the full-size Blazer and Jimmy models. This situation lasted into the early 1990s. GMC first rebadged the full-size Jimmy as the 'Yukon' in 1991. Chevrolet however waited until 1994, when they rebadged the redesigned mid-size S-10 Blazer as their 'new Blazer', while renaming the full-size Blazer as the 'Tahoe'. The name Tahoe refers to the rugged and scenic area surrounding Lake Tahoe in the western United States. The name Yukon refers to the Yukon territory of northern Canada. 
For the 1995 model year, the Tahoe and Yukon gained a new, longer 4-door model, slotting in size between the 2-door models and the longer wheelbase Chevrolet/GMC Suburbans.
The Tahoe is sold in North America, parts of Asia such as the Philippines and the Middle East, plus other countries including Bolivia, Chile, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, and Angola as a left-hand drive vehicle. The Yukon is only sold in North America and the Middle East.
The Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon currently serve as a part of General Motors' full-size SUV family and are differentiated from similar models the Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon XL primarily by the length of the passenger and cargo area behind the C pillar.

Chevrolet had introduced its popular small block V8 in 1955, but needed something larger to power its medium duty trucks and the heavier cars that were on the drawing board.  The big block, which debuted in 1958 at 348 cu in (5.7 L), was built in standard displacements up to 494 cu in (8.1 L), with aftermarket crate engines sold by Chevrolet exceeding 500 cu in (8.2 L)."

Referred to as a ""small-block"" for its size relative to the physically much larger Chevrolet big-block engines, The small block family spanned from 262 cu in (4.3 L) to 400 cu in (6.6 L) in displacement. Engineer Ed Cole is credited with leading the design for this engine. The engine block and cylinder heads were cast at Saginaw Metal Casting Operations in Saginaw, Michigan.
Generation I and Generation II LT engines are distinct from subsequent LS-based small-block engines. The Generation II engine is largely an improved version of the Generation I, having many interchangeable parts and dimensions. Later generation engines have only the rod bearings, transmission-to-block bolt pattern and bore spacing in common with the Generation I and II engines.Production of the original small-block began in late 1954 for the 1955 model year, with a displacement of 265 cu in (4.3 L), growing over time to 400 cu in (6.6 L) by 1970. Among the intermediate displacements were the 283 cu in (4.6 L), 327 cu in (5.4 L), and numerous 350 cu in (5.7 L) versions. Introduced as a performance engine in 1967, the 350 went on to be employed in both high- and low-output variants across the entire Chevrolet product line.
Although all of Chevrolet's siblings of the period (Buick, Cadillac, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Holden) designed their own V8s, it was the Chevrolet 305 and 350 cu in (5.0 and 5.7 L) small-block that became the GM corporate standard. Over the years, every American General Motors division except Saturn and Geo used it and its descendants in their vehicles.Finally superseded by the Generation III LS in 1997 and discontinued in 2003, the engine is still made by a GM subsidiary in Springfield, MO as a crate engine for replacement and hot rodding purposes. In all, over 100,000,000 small-blocks have been built in carbureted and fuel injected forms since 1955 as of November 29, 2011. The small-block family line was honored as one of the 10 Best Engines of the 20th Century by automotive magazine Ward's AutoWorld.In February 2008 a Wisconsin businessman reported that his 1991 Chevrolet C1500 pickup had logged over 1 million miles without any major repairs to its small block V8 engine.

6882.0,0,Chrysler,"Chrysler (; officially Stellantis North America) is one of the ""Big Three"" automobile manufacturers in the United States, headquartered in Auburn Hills, Michigan. It is the American subsidiary of Dutch-domiciled automotive company Stellantis. In addition to the Chrysler brand, Stellantis North America sells vehicles worldwide under the Dodge, Jeep, and Ram nameplates. It also includes Mopar, its automotive parts and accessories division, and SRT, its performance automobile division.
The original Chrysler Corporation was founded in 1925 by Walter Chrysler from the remains of the Maxwell Motor Company. It was acquired by Daimler-Benz, which in 1998 renamed itself DaimlerChrysler. After Daimler divested Chrysler in 2007, the company operated as Chrysler LLC (2007–2009) and Chrysler Group LLC (2009–2014) before being acquired by Fiat S.p.A. and becoming a subsidiary of the newly formed Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (""FCA"") in 2014. Chrysler in 2021 is a subsidiary of Stellantis, the company formed from the merger between FCA and PSA Group (Peugeot Société Anonyme) in 2021.
After founding the company, Walter Chrysler used the General Motors brand diversification and hierarchy strategy that he had become familiar with when he worked in the Buick division at General Motors. He then acquired Fargo Trucks and the Dodge Brothers Company, and created the Plymouth and DeSoto brands in 1928. Facing postwar declines in market share, productivity, and profitability, as GM and Ford were growing, Chrysler borrowed $250 million in 1954 from Prudential Insurance to pay for expansion and updated car designs.Chrysler expanded into Europe by taking control of French, British, and Spanish auto companies in the 1960s; Chrysler Europe was sold in 1978 to PSA Peugeot Citroën for $1. The company struggled to adapt to changing markets, increased U.S. import competition, and safety and environmental regulation in the 1970s. It began an engineering partnership with Mitsubishi Motors, and began selling Mitsubishi vehicles branded as Dodge and Plymouth in North America. On the verge of bankruptcy in the late 1970s, it was saved by $1.5 billion in loan guarantees from the U.S. government. New CEO Lee Iacocca was credited with returning the company to profitability in the 1980s. In 1985, Diamond-Star Motors was created, further expanding the Chrysler-Mitsubishi relationship. In 1987, Chrysler acquired American Motors Corporation (AMC), which brought the profitable Jeep brand under the Chrysler umbrella. In 1998, Chrysler merged with German automaker Daimler-Benz to form DaimlerChrysler AG; the merger proved contentious with investors. As a result, Chrysler was sold to Cerberus Capital Management and renamed Chrysler LLC in 2007.
Like the other Big Three automobile manufacturers, Chrysler was impacted by the automotive industry crisis of 2008–2010. The company remained in business through a combination of negotiations with creditors, filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization on April 30, 2009, and participating in a bailout from the U.S. government through the Troubled Asset Relief Program. On June 10, 2009, Chrysler emerged from the bankruptcy proceedings with the United Auto Workers pension fund, Fiat S.p.A., and the U.S. and Canadian governments as principal owners. The bankruptcy resulted in Chrysler defaulting on over $4 billion in debts. By May 24, 2011, Chrysler finished repaying its obligations to the U.S. government five years early, although the cost to the American taxpayer was $1.3 billion. Over the next few years, Fiat gradually acquired the other parties' shares while removing much of the weight of the loans (which carried a 21% interest rate) in a short period.
On January 1, 2014, Fiat S.p.A. announced a deal to purchase the rest of Chrysler from the United Auto Workers retiree health trust. The deal was completed on January 21, 2014, making Chrysler Group a subsidiary of Fiat S.p.A. In May 2014, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles was established by merging Fiat S.p.A. into the company.

5606572.0,0,Chrysler 180,"The Chrysler 180 was the base name for a series of large saloon cars produced by Chrysler Europe. Resulting from joining development efforts of Rootes Group and Simca, the car was produced from 1970 to 1975 in Poissy, France, and later in Chrysler's subsidiary Barreiros' factory in Spain. The Chrysler 180 was also the base for the medium-sized model built by Chrysler Australia, the Chrysler Centura.
Depending on engine employed, the cars were marketed as Chrysler 160/180/2 litre, and since 1977 in France and rest of continental Europe as Chrysler-Simca 1609/1610/2 litres. After the takeover of Chrysler Europe by PSA Peugeot Citroën, the continental Europe models were renamed Talbot 1610/2 litres for 1979 and 1980 model years, after which the model was discontinued in Europe save for Spain, where a diesel model was sold until 1982.
The large, American-inspired Chrysler fared quite poorly in the principal European markets. The replacement for the car was developed by Chrysler Europe under the codename C9 and was finally launched by PSA as the even more ill-fated Talbot Tagora."

The second generation 300 was marketed as the Chrysler 300C in the United Kingdom and Ireland and as the Lancia Thema in the remainder of Europe.The Chrysler 300 continues a very long tradition of large front engine, rear wheel drive V8 powered sedans the company has offered, starting in the 1940s with the Chrysler Saratoga and Chrysler New Yorker, followed by the Chrysler Windsor, Chrysler Newport, Chrysler Cordoba and the Chrysler Fifth Avenue. When the company began operations in 1925, the Chrysler Six was entered as a roadster in the 1925 24 Hours of Le Mans where it finished the race, and in 1926, the Chrysler Imperial started the tradition of luxury and performance products. The original Chrysler FirePower Hemi engine was used in a specialty racecar and finished the 1952 Le Mans, 1953 Le Mans and 1954 Le Mans endurance races, as well as the 1953 12 Hours of Sebring.

After the initial year, which was named C-300 for its standard 300 hp (220 kW) 331 cu in (5.4 L) FirePower V8, the 1956 cars were designated 300B. Successive model years were given the next letter of the alphabet as a suffix (skipping ""i""), reaching the 300L by 1965, after which the model sequence was discontinued. At its introduction it was advertised as ""America's Most Powerful Car"".The 300 ""letter series"" cars were among the vehicles built by Chrysler after World War II that focused on performance, and thus can be considered the beginning of the muscle car, though full-sized and more expensive. Chrysler had a long history of producing race car products going back to the Chrysler Six that was entered in the 1925 24 Hours of Le Mans, 1928 24 Hours of Le Mans, 1929 24 Hours of Le Mans, and the Chrysler Imperial Eight roadster in the 1931 24 Hours of Le Mans. The 1955 C-300 and the 1956 300B were raced with very little modification at NASCAR races to include Watkins Glen International where it won races multiple times.The automaker reintroduced the 300 designations again for performance-luxury sedans in 1999, using the 300M nameplate from 1999 to 2004, and expanding the 300 series with a reintroduction of a new Hemi-engineered V8 installed in the 300C, the top model of a new Chrysler 300 line, a new rear-wheel drive car launched in 2004 for the 2005 model year."

At the time, it was considered a luxurious ""muscle car"", with all the performance of the Dodge and Plymouth products of the time, but with the luxury features expected of the Chrysler name.
The 300 was positioned as a more affordable version of the exclusive 300 ""letter series"", and a sporty variant of a full-size automobile, adding 4-door hardtop version and running alongside that model until its discontinuation in 1966.

It consists of five banks of inline-6 cylinder engines.  It was born out of the necessity for a rear-mounted tank engine to be developed and produced in the shortest time possible for use in  the M3A4 Lee medium tank and its successor M4A4 Sherman medium tank.  Each had lengthened hulls to accommodate the A57.
In order to use existing tooling, five 250.6 cu in (4.1 L) Chrysler flathead engines (bore 3.4375 in or 87 mm, stroke 4.5 in or 114 mm) were arranged around a central shaft, producing a unique 30-cylinder 21-litre (1,253 cu in) engine in a relatively compact but heavy package. The crankshafts were fitted with gears, which drove a sun gear arrangement. With iron block and head, it featured Carter TD-1 carburetors and 6.2:1 compression ratio, for an output of 370 hp (280 kW) at 2400 rpm. It necessitated a longer hull (same as the M4A6), becoming the M4A4; most of these were supplied to Allied countries under Lend-Lease.In the February 1944 issue of the magazine Popular Science,  an advertisement by Chrysler claimed the A57 could still move the tank it was fitted in even if 12 out of its 30 cylinders were knocked out.A total of 109 Lees and 7,499 Shermans were fitted with the A57.  The M4A4 was largely supplied to the British, the US preferring the M4A3 with the more conventional Ford GAA V8 engine, and restricting their M4A4s to overseas use."

6307608.0,0,Chrysler Atlantic,"The Chrysler Atlantic was a retro concept car created by Chrysler. It was first shown in 1995. The Atlantic was designed by Bob Hubbach and inspired by the Bugatti Atlantique. The idea for this car began out as a sketch on a napkin by Chrysler's president Bob Lutz in early 1993 and also involved the automaker's chief designer, Tom Gale.
The Atlantic has several similarities to the opulent vehicles of the 1930s such as the aforementioned Bugatti Type 57S Atlantique (or Atlantic). Its styling is also more than a little inspired by the Talbot-Lago T150 SS Coupe that was constructed in 1938, such as the shape of the side windows and the curved boot. Some of the retro details include a straight-8-engine that was actually constructed from two 4-cylinder Dodge Neon engines with an S configuration 4.0 L., which is rarely used in modern cars. Other retro touches to the car's look include the interior that is replete with Art Deco-style gauges. The Atlantic Concept has around 360 horsepower (268.5 kW) and uses Chrysler's Autostick transmission. Riding on a 128-inch (3,251 mm) wheelbase, its front wheels measure 21 inches and 22 inches in the rear — large at that time.
It was one of Chrysler's most popular concept vehicles and has proven popular enough to still make the occasional public appearance.
The Atlantic's popularity has also allowed its overall design and image to be associated as part of both advertising and labeling of packages associated with a variety of automotive car care products, accessories, and electronics."

The 1962-1979 platform underwent significant changes during its lifetime, but all of Chrysler's B-platform cars in a given model year shared the same chassis, with only styling differences between the Dodge and Plymouth models. The cars were otherwise mechanically identical. Similarly, the 1988-1992 Premier and Monaco models differed only by styling and shared the same front-wheel drive B-body platform.
The Plymouth B-body series ultimately comprised four cars with nearly identical outward appearances (differing only in trim package, drive train and accessories). These were the Belvedere, Satellite, GTX and Road Runner. The Superbird was a Road Runner with an extended nose cone and front fenders borrowed from the Dodge Charger Daytona, and a high-mounted rear wing. The Superbird's unique styling was a result of homologation requirements for using the same aerodynamic nose and rear wing when racing the car in the NASCAR series of the time.
There was more diversity in the outward appearance of the Dodge B-body series. The Dodge models based on the B-body were the Coronet, Super Bee and the Charger. The Charger Daytona was a Charger with an extended nose and high-mounted rear wing, offered for the same reasons as the Superbird.

An annex was completed in 1952, and the building was sold by the Chrysler family the next year, with numerous subsequent owners.
When the Chrysler Building opened, there were mixed reviews of the building's design, ranging from views of it as inane and unoriginal to the idea that it was modernist and iconic. Perceptions of the building have slowly evolved into its now being seen as a paragon of the Art Deco architectural style; and in 2007, it was ranked ninth on the List of America's Favorite Architecture by the American Institute of Architects.

4208804.0,0,Chrysler CCV,"The Chrysler CCV (CCV stands for Composite Concept Vehicle) was a concept car designed by Bryan Nesbitt to illustrate new means of construction suitable for developing nations. 
The car is a tall, fairly roomy 4-door hatchback, of modest dimensions. The designers at Chrysler note they were inspired to create a modernized Citroën 2CV. 
The Chrysler CCV featured an injection-molded plastic body with a fabric roof and an air-cooled 2-cylinder engine driving the front wheels. It was designed to be cheap and easy to manufacture in countries with poor transportation and utility infrastructure and minimal access to capital and skilled labor. The car's simplicity would have ensured longevity and reliability in harsh conditions and made it easy for owners to do their own maintenance and repair work. Despite its lightweight construction, the CCV performed well in front and rear crash tests, although its lack of structural support in the doors and side pillars would have prevented sales in first-world markets. 
The CCV was initially developed in the mid-1990s, and earmarked for production, beginning with a joint venture operation in China. However, logistical problems with the injection molding process combined with the rationalization that occurred following Chrysler's 1998 takeover by Daimler-Benz to effectively kill the project. Techniques developed to manufacture CCV bodyshells were ultimately utilized in the production of plastic hardtops for the Jeep Wrangler.Although the CCV project was essentially terminated in 1998, Chrysler Group continues to actively exhibit the several prototypes produced at a variety of venues, including at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in 2000."

The car was styled by Elwood Engel and the Chrysler studios and featured power brakes, power steering, and a TorqueFlite transmission. It featured a metallic, root beer-colored paint called ""turbine bronze"".
The Chrysler turbine engine program that produced the Turbine Car began during the late 1930s and created prototypes that completed long-distance trips in the 1950s and early 1960s. The A-831 engines that powered the Ghia-designed Turbine Car could operate on many fuels, required less maintenance, and lasted longer than conventional piston engines, although they were much more expensive to produce. 
After testing, Chrysler conducted a user program from October 1963 to January 1966 that involved 203 drivers in 133 cities in the United States cumulatively driving more than one million miles (1.6 million km). The program helped the company determine problems with the cars, notably with their complicated starting procedure, relatively unimpressive acceleration, and sub-par fuel economy and noise. The experience also revealed advantages of the turbine engines, including their remarkable durability, smooth operation, and relatively modest maintenance requirements.
After the user program ended in 1966, Chrysler reclaimed the cars and destroyed all but nine; Chrysler kept two cars, six are displayed at museums in the United States, and one is in a private collection. Chrysler's turbine engine program ended in 1979, largely due to the failure of the engines to meet government emissions regulations, relatively poor fuel economy, and as a condition of receiving a government loan in 1979."

863298.0,0,Chrysler Valiant,"The Chrysler Valiant was a full-size car which was sold by Chrysler Australia between 1962 and 1981. Initially a rebadged locally assembled Plymouth Valiant from the United States, from the second generation launched in 1963, the Valiant was fully manufactured in Australia. It was sold locally but also in New Zealand and South Africa, with smaller numbers also exported to South-East Asia and the United Kingdom.
Parent company Chrysler made a substantial investment in Australian manufacturing facilities, by establishing operations in South Australia with an assembly plant at Tonsley Park in 1964 and an engine foundry at Lonsdale in 1968. The Valiant thus established its position as the third of the ""Big 3"" Australian-made vehicles behind the Holden Kingswood and Ford Falcon.
The Australian Valiant was built on the North American A-body platform but with many parts and components from Australian suppliers. Apart from a sedan and wagon body style, 1965 saw the introduction of a commercial utility that was badged the Wayfarer and later exported to South Africa as the Rustler. 
Greater differentiation from the donor car creeped in over time, particularly since the VE series, which was embraced by the Australian motoring press and won the 1967 Wheels magazine Car of the Year award. The VF series of 1969 and the VG of 1970 departed even further from its North American donor both in terms of styling and performance—with the latter series introducing the Hemi-6 engine that replaced the Slant-6. Moreover, Australia continued to produce a station wagon model, called the Safari, even after this body style being discontinued for North America.
Beginning in 1971, the VH series saw Chrysler Australia develop the entire lineup locally including the Charger. Local design and production continued until the CM series of 1979, which marked the end of local production in 1981, after the takeover of operations by Mitsubishi Motors Australia."

It was marketed and badged as the Valiant Charger in the VH and VJ series and as the Chrysler Charger in the later VK and CL series.
While still based on the US Chrysler A-body platform, with virtually identical front suspension, the fenders were widened, and a wider rear axle fitted, so that the track, front and rear, was considerably wider than any US A-body, this also allowed wheels much wider than a US A-body. The Australian Chargers also used a 5-on-4.5"" wheel bolt circle (still 7/16"" studs), while the US cars did not go to ""big bolt pattern"" until 1973.
The Charger was extraordinarily popular in Australia during the VH series. At one point Charger production totalled 80% of all Australian Valiant production.
The VH Valiant Charger achieved critical acclaim, winning the 1971 Australian Wheels Car of the Year Award. It was also popular in New Zealand where they were assembled from imported kits.
The sporty image of the Charger faded through the VJ range of cars and was neutered altogether by 1975 release of the VK series.

In the current lineup, it is positioned as the lower-end Chrysler minivan, having replaced the Dodge Grand Caravan in 2020, below the Chrysler Pacifica.
The Chrysler Voyager was introduced in Europe in 1988, and was a rebadged version of the Dodge Caravan in the United States. It originally evolved with the Caravan, the Plymouth Voyager, and the Chrysler Town & Country. In the United States, the Chrysler Voyager nameplate replaced the short-wheelbase (SWB) version of the Plymouth Voyager following the folding of the Plymouth division by DaimlerChrysler AG in 2001, and was discontinued in 2003. The nameplate was revived for the 2021 model year following the discontinuation of the Dodge Grand Caravan after the 2020 model year, and is rebadged as the Chrysler Grand Caravan in Canada.In Europe, the Chrysler Voyager was rebadged as the Lancia Voyager from the 2011 to 2016 model years. The Voyager was sold with different engines, including diesel engines, and was also available with manual transmission and a foot-operated emergency brake. Although now produced solely in Ontario, Canada, the Grand Voyagers were still available with diesel engines as standard. These diesel engines are based on a modern double overhead cam common rail design from VM Motori of Italy. The last European Chrysler Grand Voyagers are very similar to the 2008 and later Chrysler Town & Country cars, and were sold only in the long-wheelbase version (as in North America). Following the fifth generation, the Grand Voyager nameplate was discontinued in all markets.
Together with its nameplate variants, the Chrysler minivans have ranked as the 13th bestselling automotive nameplate worldwide, with over 12 million sold."
1453796.0,0,Chrysler Windsor,"The Chrysler Windsor is a full-size car which was built by Chrysler from 1939 through to the 1960s.  The final Chrysler Windsor sold in the United States was produced in 1961, but production in Canada continued until 1966. The Canadian 1961 to 1966 Windsor model was for all intents and purposes the equivalent of the Chrysler Newport in the United States.
The Windsor was almost identical to the more luxurious Chrysler New Yorker in terms of size, interior and standard features except that it was only available with the Chrysler Straight Six that originally started the company in 1925, which offered customers a luxurious car with a more modest and economic engine. As the years progressed and technology and manufacturing costs improved, the Windsor offered items that were initially optional as standard equipment while maintaining a market position lower in the Chrysler product hierarchy.
The Windsor was mechanically similar to the Royal from 1939 to 1950 and offered more standard equipment and an upscale interior to the well equipped Royal while both vehicles came with the Chrysler Straight Six. As the Royal nameplate was discontinued for the 1951 model year the Windsor became Chrysler's six cylinder coupe until 1955 when the Poly V8 was introduced. For the 1961 model year the Chrysler Newport assumed the market position originally held by the Royal, keeping the Windsor positioned one level above the Newport. Chrysler replaced the Windsor name in 1962 with the introduction of the non-lettered series Chrysler 300.

26024239.0,0,Chrysler ball-stud hemi,"The ball-stud hemi (known internally as A279 and affectionately as the BS Hemi)  was an automobile engine designed by Chrysler Corporation in the late 1960s. It never entered production.Intended to deal with the troubles created by the low-production 426, of which only about 9,000 were built from 1966 to 1972), as well as the different architectures of the higher-volume 383 cu in (6.3 l) and 400 cu in (6.6 l) B and 440 cu in (7.2 l) RB V8s, the ball-stud hemi was to be suitable for high-volume manufacture at low cost while generating high performance. Chrysler hoped to replace three block and two head designs with the ball-stud design.  It was to be based on a low-deck block and available in 400 cu in (6.6 l) (4.34 by 3.38 in (110 by 86 mm)) and 440 cu in (7.2 l) 4.32 by 3.75 in (110 by 95 mm)) displacements (and Chrysler considered a 444 cu in (7.3 l), which could have used stock 4.34 in (110 mm) 400 cu in (6.6 l) pistons), while the new valvetrain would cut both weight and cost, as well as making it possible to fit it in a greater variety of models.The A279 initially used the B-block head bolt pattern, which ""badly hampered"" its exhaust ports, forcing the use of a serpentine flow around some of the outer bolts This was changed late in development, but not before some tooling based on the original design had already been created. This meant the head was not truly hemispherical, but had more intake port area than exhaust (3.575 in2 (23.06 cm2)  versus (2.488 in2 (16.05 cm2)).Its intake valves were nearer the intake manifold, exhaust valves nearer the exhaust pipes. The staggered ""poly"" arrangement improves airflow by ""reducing valve shrouding and eliminating the sharp runner turns"" of inline valve arrangements. It also had equally spaced intake ports (similar to the 428SCJ), thereby achieving ""more consistent mixture distribution"" than the Wedges. Chrysler used a 14 mm (0.55 in) spark plug, rather than the typical 18 mm (0.71 in), in an effort to fit it as centrally as possible in the combustion chamber.The intake and exhaust valves were the same size as the 426's, the 2.25 in (57 mm) intake canted at 15° from the bore centerline, the 1.94 in (49 mm) exhaust at 6°. By contrast, the B-block's were 2.08 in (53 mm) and 1.74 in (44 mm).Compared to the wedge, the ball-stud block had two additional clean-out holes to remove casting sand, because the large bore made coolant in the water jacket very significant, and an additional oil drainback hole at either end of the block, due to demand for lubrication of the rocker arms. Suggestions to increase the size of the oil pump pickup to 3⁄8 in (9.5 mm)  (compared to the 426's 1⁄2 in (12.7 mm)) never passed the endurance testing stage.Pistons were to be cast aluminum. Compression ratio was targeted as 10.5:1; on the surviving engine, it was measured at 9.8:1. Forged  connecting rods used the Wedge's 3⁄8 in (9.5 mm) hardware, as opposed to the Hemi's 7⁄16 in (11.1 mm), but would nonetheless have been considered high-performance parts.The intake was to be a single Carter ThermoQuad, of greater flow than any previously used, on a dual-plane intake manifold, while dual four-barrels were never even considered, in the face of toughening emissions standards. A split-level (vertically split, rather than horizontally divided) intake was also experimented with.Chrysler hoped to have the ball-stud in production sometime between 1971 and 1973. In testing, it proved able to outperform the single four-barrel carburetted A134 440, and lagged behind the eight-barrel A102 426 Street Hemi. About one year of development was put in before the project was stopped, in late 1969. It was a victim of increasing demand for emissions controls and a reduction in emphasis on performance, as the ""horsepower wars"" wound down. Moreover, Chrysler was suffering ""severe financial stresses"" that nearly brought the company down, so the new production tooling and facilities were now uneconomic.Estimates of the number built vary from three to twelve. Only one is known to survive."

In production since the 1984 model year, Chrysler has produced six distinct generations of minivans; at various stages of their production, Chrysler minivans have been marketed worldwide, primarily in North America and Europe.
Initially introduced as the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager, the Chrysler minivans have been marketed under a variety of nameplates under Chrysler, Plymouth, Dodge, and Ram brands; through the use of rebadging, Chrysler minivans have also been marketed under the Lancia and Volkswagen brands.
The Chrysler minivans are the highest-selling example of the segment, with over 12 million produced up to 2008 and a grand total of 15 million reached in 2019.The introduction of the Chrysler minivans popularized the use of the body style by automakers in the United States and Canada, leading to competitors such as the Chevrolet Astro/GMC Safari, Ford Aerostar, Toyota Previa, and Mazda MPV. During the 1990s, the popularity of the Chrysler minivans led to the form factor becoming closely followed by many competitors, leading to the Ford Windstar/Freestar, Honda Odyssey, Toyota Sienna, Kia Sedona, and Nissan Quest.
Since their 1984 introduction, Chrysler has manufactured minivans at Windsor Assembly, in Windsor, Ontario, Canada; from 1987 to 2007, Saint Louis Assembly in Fenton, Missouri added additional manufacturing in North America.

Founded as the Dodge Brothers Company machine shop by brothers Horace Elgin Dodge and John Francis Dodge in the early 1900s, Dodge was originally a supplier of parts and assemblies to Detroit-based automakers like Ford. They began building complete automobiles under the ""Dodge Brothers"" brand in 1914, predating the founding of Chrysler Corporation. The factory located in Hamtramck, Michigan was the Dodge main factory from 1910 until it closed in January 1980. John Dodge died from the Spanish flu in January 1920, having lungs weakened by tuberculosis 20 years earlier. Horace died in December of the same year, perhaps weakened by the Spanish flu, though the cause of death was cirrhosis of the liver. Their company was sold by their families to Dillon, Read & Co. in 1925 before being sold to Chrysler in 1928.
Dodge mainstay vehicles were trucks and full-sized passenger cars through the 1970s, though it also built compact cars such as the 1963–76 Dart and midsize cars such as the ""B-Body"" Coronet and Charger from 1965–78.
The 1973 oil embargo caused American ""gas guzzler"" sales to slump, prompting Chrysler to develop the Dodge Aries K platform compact and midsize cars for the 1981 model year. The K platform and its derivatives are credited with reviving Chrysler's business in the 1980s. One example was the Dodge Caravan. During the 1990s the Dodge Stratus found many buyers along with the larger Dodge Intrepid.

Founded as the Dodge Brothers Company machine shop by brothers Horace Elgin Dodge and John Francis Dodge in the early 1900s, Dodge was originally a supplier of parts and assemblies to Detroit-based automakers like Ford. They began building complete automobiles under the ""Dodge Brothers"" brand in 1914, predating the founding of Chrysler Corporation. The factory located in Hamtramck, Michigan was the Dodge main factory from 1910 until it closed in January 1980. John Dodge died from the Spanish flu in January 1920, having lungs weakened by tuberculosis 20 years earlier. Horace died in December of the same year, perhaps weakened by the Spanish flu, though the cause of death was cirrhosis of the liver. Their company was sold by their families to Dillon, Read & Co. in 1925 before being sold to Chrysler in 1928.
Dodge mainstay vehicles were trucks and full-sized passenger cars through the 1970s, though it also built compact cars such as the 1963–76 Dart and midsize cars such as the ""B-Body"" Coronet and Charger from 1965–78.
The 1973 oil embargo caused American ""gas guzzler"" sales to slump, prompting Chrysler to develop the Dodge Aries K platform compact and midsize cars for the 1981 model year. The K platform and its derivatives are credited with reviving Chrysler's business in the 1980s. One example was the Dodge Caravan. During the 1990s the Dodge Stratus found many buyers along with the larger Dodge Intrepid.
The Dodge brand endured multiple ownership changes at Chrysler from 1998 to 2009, including its merger with Daimler-Benz AG from 1998 to 2007, its subsequent sale to Cerberus Capital Management, its 2009 bailout by the United States government, and its subsequent Chapter 11 bankruptcy and acquisition by Fiat.
In 2011, Dodge and its sub-brands, Dodge Ram and Dodge Viper, were separated. Dodge announced that the Viper was to be an SRT product, and Ram a standalone marque. In 2014, SRT was merged back into Dodge. Later that year, the Chrysler Group was renamed FCA US LLC, coinciding with the merger of Fiat S.p.A. and the Chrysler Group into the corporate structure of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Subsequently, another merger occurred on January 16, 2021 between FCA and the PSA Group (Stellantis), making the Dutch-domiciled automaker the second largest in Europe, after Volkswagen."

3679928.0,0,Dodge & Cox,"Dodge & Cox is an American mutual fund company, founded in 1930 by Van Duyn Dodge and E. Morris Cox, that provides professional investment management services. 
Dodge and Cox specializes in value investing and has been described as ""best known for its conservatively managed funds with solid track records and modest fees."" Having been created during the Great Depression, the firm has ""a razor sharp focus on capital preservation"". Co-founder E. Morris Cox, who worked at the firm into his 90s, objected to widespread practices he considered unethical during the early 20th Century history of investment banking and thus Dodge & Cox developed policies putting customer interests as a top priority. Dodge & Cox practices a team-based management strategy and as of 2020, the firm had US$325 billion in assets under management, and one of their funds was among the largest 25 American mutual funds.Headquartered in San Francisco, California, the company offers six no-load mutual funds as of December 2020: a domestic stock fund, an international stock fund, a balanced fund, an income fund, a global stock fund, and a global bond fund. In August 2020, Dodge & Cox filed a registration statement with the SEC for an emerging markets stock fund.Their balanced fund, comprising 50-70% large company stocks and the remainder in bonds, was established in 1931 and is one of the oldest US mutual funds still in operation as of February 2019. Unusually for an investment firm, particularly of their size, Dodge & Cox does not advertise, has only one office and ""has no public relations office and no sales force."" In 2007, Dodge and Cox ranked second after The Vanguard Group for overall customer satisfaction in a survey by Cogent Research of customers with at least $100,000 in mutual fund assets.Due to their devotion to the principles of value investing, Dodge & Cox avoided the worst of the dot com bubble during the late 1990s and early 2000 by limiting their exposure to overvalued and then-trendy internet stocks, thereby significantly out-performing the broader market when the bubble collapsed. According to a 2017 Morningstar, Inc. analysis, the firm's low staff turnover and investing principles have been largely beneficial over the long-term, though with bouts of sluggishness when growth stocks were more in favor than value stocks. From 2012 to 2016, their US large company fund saw substantial outflows of $10 billion dollars due in part to the increasing popularity of lower fee index funds, but in this same period their other funds saw more contributions than withdrawals.John C. Bogle of The Vanguard Group was a strong proponent of index funds, but singled out Dodge & Cox among a handful of active mutual fund managers he would recommend due to their low fees, sober management and avoidance of trends."

11085681.0,0,Dodge Chicago Plant,"The Dodge Chicago Aircraft Engine Plant was a World War II defense plant that built the majority of the B-29 bomber aircraft engines used in World War II.
The plant design was initiated by automotive plant designer Albert Kahn and his company. The plant is seen as an influential design landmark of American industrial manufacturing facilities. The main building of the Dodge Chicago plant covered eighty-two acres and occupied over 30 city blocks, and at the time was the largest building in the world. Although Kahn died prior to the completion of the project, he was influential in the innovative design that efficiently utilized precious wartime materials used in its construction. Kahn had extensive tunnels dug to facilitate foot and supply traffic. These tunnels span the width and breadth of the plant in a tic-tac-toe pattern. Wooden block floors were placed for ergonomic reasons, which was typical for industrial plants of the day. These floors were cemented over when the facility was converted into Ford City Mall, and only recently had to be removed from TRI (candy maker Tootsie Roll Industries) as posing a potential health hazard. The Belt Line Railroad shunted lines into the plant, and to this day evidence of the rails remain. Construction of the plant was started in 1942, and it was in full operation by early 1944. 

The B-29 Superfortress bomber was used in the strategic bombing campaign against Japan. It was the largest American aircraft to see service in World War II. Each B-29 Superfortress utilized four of the massive Wright R-3350 - Cyclone 18-cylinder 2,200 horsepower (1,600 kW) engines built at the Dodge Chicago Plant. There were nearly 4000 of these aircraft produced when the B-29 was retired from service in the 1960s. Many firsts in industry took place there. Chemist Lencke produced Z-max lubricant. 75% of the employees were women, 1 to 2 percent of whom were African Americans.
The Dodge Chicago plant marked an all-time high water mark of cooperation and success between the efforts of the American government, industry, and labor. It also set an early standard for providing an environment of racial and ethnic cooperation and tolerance.
After the war, a lease for the plant was awarded to the Tucker Car Corporation, and it later utilized by several automobile manufacturers including Ford Motor Company. Tootsie Roll Industries moved into  a vacated portion of the plant in 1967. To this day, TRI uses these tunnels for archives and storage as well as locker rooms, as Ford City uses them for a strip of boutiques. The plant was constructed just east of South Cicero Avenue and was a half-mile long from 72nd Street to 76th Street, and nearly a half-mile wide, reaching South Kostner Avenue in Chicago's West Lawn community. To this day, the northern two-thirds of its buildings still house the Tootsie Roll factory, and a section that was demolished for a parking lot which separates Tootsie Roll from the Ford City Mall."

Since the A100 was a cabover design, Schaeffer and Collier opted to install the drivetrain in the pickup bed, within a welded steel subframe.Parts deemed unnecessary were removed from the body, among them the heater, dashboard, front bumper, and all body sealer. The Little Red Wagon's first dragstrip run netted a mid-11 second quarter mile at 120 mph (190 km/h).The vehicle was not originally intended to perform wheelstands; the slight rearward weight bias caused the nose to lift in the air for nearly the entire quarter-mile run. The truck was initially given to Dick Branstner Enterprises and Roger Lindamood to help sort out the ill-handling and unpredictable truck.  The team's Dodge Color Me Gone entry had just won the 1964 U.S. Nationals. They enlisted Jay Howell as driver; and the first known photo of it doing a wheelstand has Howell behind the wheel.  Chrysler's Director of Marketing, Frank Wylie, arranged for Super Stock Champion Bill ""Maverick"" Golden to purchase the truck.Golden turned the A100 pickup into the first exhibition wheelstander. The truck toured extensively throughout the United States and was used in television commercials for Dodge trucks. The Little Red Wagon debuted in the 1965 season opener at Lions Drag Strip in Wilmington, California, in front of 10,000 fans and reporters from major newspapers and automotive publications. 
The vehicle suffered wrecks in 1969, 1971, and 1975.  After the 1975 wreck, Golden converted a non-operable show truck and campaigned it until he retired in 2003.Golden entered the Guinness Book of World Records in 1977 with a 4230' (1289m) wheelstand, approximately the length of three quarter-mile dragstrips.In 2009, the replacement Little Red Wagon from 1975  was sold at RM Auctions Icons of Speed and Style Auction.  The vehicle was expected to fetch US$300,000; it was instead the auction's top seller at $550,000.In 2015, the original Little Red Wagon was sold to stunt driver Mike Mantel, also the current driver of the Hemi Under Glass wheelstander. Mantel has converted a 1965 Dodge A100 into a Little Red Wagon wheelstander to perform and tour with the original crashed truck on display.It is also the subject of a 1/25 scale model kit from IMC which was later reissued by Lindberg Models."

28170973.0,0,Dodge M4S,"The Dodge M4S is an American high performance prototype sports coupe originally engineered, designed, and built by Dodge in 1981 as a technology demonstrator vehicle. It was designed by then chief designer of Dodge, Bob Ackerman. The designation M4S denotes ""Midengine, 4 cylinder, Sport“. From its conception, the car was intended to be built as a fully engineered running prototype rather than as a display piece.  Because it was intended to be used as a pace car, it was designed to reach a top speed of 200 mph (322 km/h).
Chrysler designed the body and conducted extensive wind tunnel testing to achieve a drag coefficient of .236.  Although the car was designed by Chrysler, actual construction of the vehicle was handled by subcontractors.  The semi monocoque race car chassis was ordered from Huffaker of California. 3-D Industries of Madison Heights, Michigan modeled the body and created molds. Special Projects, Inc. of Plymouth, Michigan cast the body panels, assembled the body and interior, and gave the car its signature “root beer brown” paint color by painting layers of pearl over a black base coat.  Specialized Vehicles, Inc., of Troy, Michigan handled fabrication, final assembly, and maintenance of the completed car.
The car was made famous by its appearance in The Wraith, a 1986 supernatural film. The mid-engined car had a tested and confirmed top speed of 194.8 mph (313.5 km/h) and could go from 0 to 60 mph (97 km/h) in 4.1 seconds, with more than 440 hp (328 kW) under the hood coming from its relatively small displacement of 2.2L 4 cylinder forced induction engine.The car has since gained an enthusiast cult following, prompted by the fame it gained from appearing in The Wraith."

1471615.0,0,Dodge Mayfair,"The Dodge Mayfair was an automobile built by Chrysler Corporation of Canada Ltd. This vehicle was produced solely for the Canadian market from 1953 to 1959. Its American equivalent was the Plymouth Belvedere.  It was based on the Plymouth.
The Mayfair name first appeared as a 2-door hardtop in the 1951 Dodge Regent series, just as the Belvedere appeared in the Cranbrook series.  The 1952 Mayfair adopted the same paint scheme as the 1952 Belvedere with the roof color sweeping down onto the rear trunk.When the 1953 models were introduced, the Mayfair was again the hardtop in the Regent series.  In April, 1953, though, Chrysler of Canada introduced a new, upscale series to do battle with the Chevrolet Bel Air and Pontiac Laurentian.
The D43-3 Mayfair was introduced in both hardtop and sedan models. The exterior had the front fender trim extend onto the front door and backup lamps were standard.  Interiors were two-tone, in either blue or green, with a matching steering wheel. With the new D43-3, the Regent Mayfair hardtop was dropped.
Under the hood, the engine was increased from 218 cu in (3,570 cc) to 228 cu in (3,740 cc) and Chrysler of Canada introduced Hy-Drive on Plymouth and Dodge models.
For 1954, the Mayfair used the interiors of the new Plymouth Belvedere. The base engine and transmission were unchanged.   For the first time since 1937, Chrysler of Canada offered a convertible in its Plymouth-based models, importing the Mayfair convertible from Detroit, a badge-engineered Kingsway Custom.
The V8 engine came to Chrysler of Canada's low-priced models in 1955. As before, the Mayfair was largely a Plymouth Belvedere, using that car's 115 in (2,900 mm) wheelbase and body with Dodge's front sheetmetal. The engines were imported from Detroit with various covers, manifolds, electrical pieces and rubber parts added in Windsor. Only the Mayfair offered a V8. And both Plymouth and Dodge offered PowerFlite 2-speed automatic with its new dash-mounted control lever. The Hy-Drive unit was eliminated.
Things changed in 1956 when Chrysler of Canada opened a new V8 engine plant. The Mayfair was now V8 only, while the lower-priced Dodge Crusader and Dodge Regent could be had with either the six or V8. Early in the model the 270 cu in (4,400 cc) V8 was installed while later the all new  277 cu in (4,540 cc)was introduced. A 4-door hardtop was added to the line and the Powerflite automatic was controlled by new dash-mounted pushbuttons.Totally new bodies designed by Virgil Exner debuted for 1957. They were a styling sensation with their low lines, plenty of glass and thin roof designs. Body engineering and tooling errors, though, resulted in a car that quickly gained a reputation for poor quality and rust.  Chrysler Corporation's new 3-speed Torqueflite automatic was now available on all Mayfair models, still only with the 303 cu in (4,970 cc) V8, and all Chrysler Corporation cars adopted Torsion-Aire torsion bar front suspension.
Sales for 1957 were down from 1956 for all Canadian-built Dodge models, but 1958 was a disaster with sales falling over 40%. Grilles, taillights and trim were all that were new for 1958.  The Mayfair adopted the 313 cu in (5,130 cc) poly V8 engine.
The Mayfair's last year was 1959, when it was downgraded a notch to take the place of the Regent, while the Crusader was dropped. The 1959 Mayfair still came in two and four door sedan and hardtop, plus the imported 3-seat Custom Suburban station wagon and convertible.  Although the wagon models were 318 CID V8 only, the other models were now available with either the 251 CID flathead six or the 313 CID V8.
For 1960 the Canadian Dodge based on the Plymouth would be replaced by another Plymouth-based car, the Dodge Dart. The Mayfair would become a sub-model of the Dart line for 1960, and renamed the Phoenix.
The vehicle has been commonly referred to as a Plodge because of the extensive use of Plymouth components with Dodge front grilles and sold at Dodge sales outlets.

2221320.0,0,Dodge Omni 024,"The Dodge Omni 024 was a modified version of the popular Dodge Omni made from 1979 to 1982. Analogous to the VW Scirocco, this car was a lower, sportier three-door hatchback coupé version of the Chrysler/Simca Horizon, using the five-door hatchback's floor pan and chassis as a basis. The cars were designed in-house at the prompting of Lee Iacocca.It used the same chassis and engine options as the Omni but had unique bodywork and front end styling. The base engine was a 1.7 L Volkswagen inline four producing 70 hp (52 kW), with a 2.2 L, 84 hp (63 kW) Chrysler inline four as an option beginning in 1981. By then, the smaller engine only produced 63 hp (47 kW). For the first year, the car had a folding back seat and the wheels were painted in the exterior color. The car's looks promised more performance than the engine could deliver, and the car was not as practical as the Omni. Both the Omni and Horizon prefixes were dropped for 1981, making them the ""024"" and ""TC3"", respectively.

The 024 did not sell well and was renamed as the Dodge Charger for the 1983 model year, a name which had been gradually introduced as part of a special ""Charger 2.2"" package beginning in 1981. The 024 had also been produced as the  Plymouth Horizon TC3. It, too, was renamed in the 1983 model year: to the Plymouth Turismo. The ""Turismo"" label had already been used on a sport package beginning in 1980.In its last year, the 024 and TC3 served as a base for the Dodge Rampage and Plymouth Scamp pick-up trucks using the same chassis, powertrain and body parts from the doors forward. 
In 1980 the Plymouth Horizon TC3 also became available with the Turismo sport package. For the Dodge Omni 024 this was called the DeTomaso package, with De Tomaso designed trim and wheels but the standard drivetrain. 1,333 De Tomaso 024's were built in 1980, followed by 619 more in 1981. The 1981 De Tomasos were only available with the new 2.2 litre engine.Also in 1980, in cooperation with Chrysler partner Mitsubishi, the Chrysler Omni 024 was briefly sold in Japan.

It borrowed its name from the top Dart, the Dodge Dart Phoenix, but unlike its American namesake it was offered only as a four-door sedan and only with a 318 cubic inch V8 engine.  All Phoenixes for Australia had right-hand drive.
The Phoenix was subsequently restyled in line with the 1961 and 1962 Dodge Dart. For 1963 the new TD2 series Phoenix was derived from the US Dodge 440, and for 1965 and beyond the Phoenix was based on the Canadian Plymouth Fury III.  Like the 1965 Fury, the 1965 Phoenix featured vertically stacked headlamps. A four-door hardtop body style joined the sedan in 1967. The hardtop was fitted with a 383 cubic inch V8 engine whilst the sedan continued with the smaller 318 cubic inch V8. The two body styles continued to be offered until the Australian Phoenix was discontinued.  In addition, variants of the slightly longer U.S. station wagon were sold from the beginning for duty as hearses.  Eventually, these were modified with two doors and oversized rear quarter windows, in the British hearse tradition.
Although the 1965 and later Phoenixes were basically Plymouth Furys, they did feature the North American style full size Dodge Polara instrument panel (adapted for right hand drive).

1183823.0,0,Dodge Power Wagon,"The Dodge Power Wagon is a four wheel drive medium duty truck that was produced in various model series from 1945 to 1980 by Dodge.  The Power Wagon name was revived for the 2005 model year as a four-wheel drive version of the  Dodge Ram 2500.  As a nameplate, ""Power Wagon"" continues as a four-wheel drive version of 3/4 ton Ram Trucks 2500 model.
The original civilian version, commonly called the ""flat fender"" Power Wagon (FFPW) or ""Military Type"", was mechanically based on Dodge's 3/4-ton WC series of World War II military trucks. The Power Wagon was the first 4x4 medium duty truck produced by a major manufacturer in a civilian version. It represents a significant predecessor to the many modern four-wheel drive trucks in use today. It was marketed as the WDX truck. Until about 1960 it was internally known by its engineering code T137 – a name still used for the original series by enthusiasts. Following Chrysler Corporation policy of badge engineering to provide a greater number of sales outlets overseas, Power Wagons were also marketed around the world under the Fargo and De Soto badges.Starting in the 1957 model year, factory four-wheel-drive versions of the Dodge C Series trucks were produced and sold as the W-100, W-200, W-300, and W-500, alongside the older Power Wagon. The pickups had the ""Power Wagon"" badge on the fender. The older design Power Wagon was marketed as the ""Military Type"" to distinguish it from the styled pickup versions. Later the ""Military Type"" was given the series number W-300M, and ultimately WM-300.
The heavy-duty four-wheel-drive W-300 and W-500 trucks were marketed as ""Power Giants"".  The four-wheel-drive version of the Dodge Town Wagon also got the ""Power Wagon"" badge.
The ""Military Type"" sales in the United States ended by 1968, because the vehicle did not comply with new federal light-duty truck regulations. The ""Power Wagon"" options continued on the Dodge D-Series through the 1980 model year. For the 1981 model year, ""Power Ram"" became the marketing logo for the medium-duty Dodge trucks, and the ""Power Wagon"" name was not used until the 2004 revival."

Engine choices were the 5.2 L/318 c.i. Magnum or the 5.9 L/360 c.i. Magnum."
402312.0,0,Dodge Rampage,"The Dodge Rampage was a subcompact, unibody coupe utility based on Chrysler's L platform and manufactured from 1982 to 1984. First released as a 1982 model, the Rampage was later joined for 1983 by its rebadged variant, the Plymouth Scamp.
The Rampage borrowed the car's unibody construction and front end panels and components from the sporty 024/Charger variant, and used the suspension from the Omni/Horizon with coil struts and a linkless sway bar at the front, and leaf springs with shock absorbers unique to the Rampage at the rear.It was available with a Chrysler built and designed 2.2 L carbureted inline-four engine with 96 hp (72 kW) and a curb weight of around 2,400 lb (1,100 kg). In the first year, it had leisurely performance due to the four-speed manual transmission along with a three-speed automatic transmission.

Performance was improved with the introduction of a five-speed manual transmission in 1983. The truck had a load capacity of 1,145 lb (519 kg), for a true ""half ton"" rating. This compared favorably to General Motors' Chevrolet El Camino's rating of 1250 lbs. In addition to the El Camino, the Volkswagen Rabbit Sportruck and Subaru BRAT were the Rampage's main competition.
In 1984, the Rampage received a facelifted front fascia shared with the Charger, with quad 165 mm x 100 mm sealed beam headlights opposed to the dual 200 mm x 142 mm sealed beam headlights found on previous models. The grille was also changed, switching from a 6-slot design to a vertically split design. The lower bumper was switched from a pronounced part that bulged out to a more sleek design with near-flush indicators, a horizontally split lower air intake, and an impact strip that wrapped around the front clip.
A rebadged version, the Plymouth Scamp, was only marketed for 1983. The Rampage lasted three years before being dropped from production after the 1984 model year. There was a ""Shelby Rampage"" built by Chrysler/Shelby engineers in their free time for Carroll Shelby, but there is no official record of the existence of such a vehicle. However, a special California market ""Direct Connection"" Rampage was built in 1984 and only sold at certain California-area Dodge dealerships, which featured the front fascia from the Shelby Charger, 15-inch alloy wheels, and a ground effects package.Only 250 ""Direct Connection"" Rampages were produced.

The Rampage Concept was first introduced at the 2006 Chicago Auto Show. The Rampage was as wide as the then-current model Dodge Ram and was larger than its 1980s predecessor. ""The Rampage was designed as a truck for people who aren't into trucks. More of a nontraditional truck buyer,"" stated exterior designer Scott Krugger upon its introduction.The Rampage Concept could accommodate a 5.7 L Hemi engine with Chrysler's Multi-Displacement System; this engine was used in contemporary production vehicles such as the Dodge Ram and Dodge Charger. Like its namesake, the Rampage Concept used front-wheel drive, unusual for a pickup truck. The Rampage also had flared fenders and 22-inch aluminum wheels.
The Rampage Concept featured ""Stow 'n Go"" seating used in Chrysler minivans of the time, where the seats folded down flush with the cabin floor; this feature was a first for any Chrysler truck. It was also the first Chrysler vehicle to apply this feature on the front passenger seat in addition to the rear seats. Combined with a retractable rear window and midgate, this allowed the bed space to expand into the cabin, at the expense of passenger space. Other distinguishing features of the Rampage Concept were a wide, flat, weatherproof cargo area beneath the bed and an integrated loading ramp."

1471619.0,0,Dodge Regent,"The Dodge Regent is an automobile that was built by Dodge Canada. The low-priced line built with a front end similar to the U.S. market Dodge attached to a Plymouth body.
The first Dodge Regent appeared for 1951, basically a Plymouth Cranbrook, and replaced the Special DeLuxe name used from 1942 through 1950.  As with all Canadian Plymouths and Dodges from 1938 to 1959, the Dodge Regent used Chrysler big block (25"") flathead inline-six engine.  While the American Plymouth used the 23"" block 217.6-cid engine, the Canadian Plymouth and Dodge used the 25"" 218.1-cid engine.  Body styles were club coupe, 4-door sedan and a new for 1951 model, the Mayfair hardtop.
The Regent continued for 1952 with minor trim changes while the 1953 models received new bodies.  As the U.S. Dodge now shared bodies with Plymouth, the Canadian Dodge Regent and Crusader, as well as the export Kingsway, used the Plymouth body with a Dodge front clip.  In April, 1953, Chrysler of Canada introduced Hy-Drive mated to a larger, 228.1-cid engine.  As well, the Mayfair hardtop was spun off into its own series along with a 4-door sedan.  1954 models received grille, trim, taillamp and interior changes and very late in the model year Powerflite automatic transmission became an option.
New styling for 1955 appeared across the Chrysler Corporation makes, and Dodge Regent continued to be a Plymouth Savoy with a Dodge front clip.  Chrysler of Canada imported polyhead V8 short blocks for use in Canadian Plymouth Belvedere and Dodge Mayfair models.  The lower-priced series, Crusader and Regent, came only with the flathead six, either 228.1-cid if mated to the 3-speed manual or 250.6-cid with the Powerflite automatic.
For 1956 new fins graced the rear fenders and Chrysler Canada opened a new engine plant for V8 production.  The plant produced 277-cid engines for Plymouth and Dodge and 303-cid engines for Canadian Dodge Custom Royal and Chrysler Windsor models.  The Regent was available with either the flathead six, now 250.6-cid, or the V8, except for the new 2-door hardtop which came only with the six.  1956 would prove to be a high-water mark for Canadian Dodge production, breaking the 50,000 mark for the first time.
Completely new Forward Look bodies appeared for 1957 - lower, wider, longer.  But due to the rush to get it into production, the bodies were plagued with tooling errors, parts mismatch, and poor body engineering. For 1958 the Regent continued on as in 1957, adding a 4-door hardtop.
1959 was the final year for the Dodge Regent, and as Plymouth placed the Fury on top and bumped the other series down a rung, so did Dodge in Canada.  The new top series was now Viscount, while Mayfair moved down to the middle series and Regent to the bottom. The Crusader name was dropped.  Body styles available were 2-door and 4-door sedans and Suburban wagons.  Engines were the 251 flathead six and 313 poly V8. For the third year in row, Canadian Dodge production was down although the Regent remained the most popular Dodge series in Canada.
Dodge introduced the Dart for 1960, and the new Dodge Dart Seneca replaced the Dodge Regent in Canadian Dodge-DeSoto dealer showrooms."

2445809.0,0,Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement,"The Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement (DRUM) was an organization of African-American workers formed in May 1968 in the Chrysler Corporation's Dodge Main assembly plant in Detroit, Michigan.
Detroit labor activist Martin Glaberman estimated at the time that the Hamtramck plant was 70 per cent black while the union local (UAW Local 3), the plant management and lower supervision, and the Hamtramck city administration was dominated by older Polish-American workers.DRUM sought to organize black workers to obtain concessions not only from the Chrysler management, but also from the United Auto Workers. Walter Reuther and the senior leadership had been early supporters of the American Civil Rights Movement; yet in spite of their growing presence in the auto-industry African-Americans rarely rose to positions of leadership within the union. On July 8, 1968 DRUM led a wildcat strike against conditions in the Hamtramck plant. The strike was observed by some 4,000 workers, lasted 2.5 days and prevented the production of 3,000 cars. In the subsequent Local 3 election, DRUM ran as an alternative slate. Although it did not win, the new organization drew notice for its militancy and willingness to challenge the UAW hierarchy.
The ""Revolutionary Union Movement"" form of organization spread to other Detroit plants: including FRUM (Ford Revolutionary Union Movement) at the Ford River Rouge Plant, and ELRUM (Eldon Avenue Revolutionary Union Movement) at the Chrysler Eldon Avenue plant. These organizations were brought together in the League of Revolutionary Black Workers which formed in June 1969.
As it grew, DRUM faced a crisis of expectations. Auto workers had created an independent organization, but opinions differed about DRUM's future mission. Debates concerned whether DRUM should continue as a reform movement within the UAW or a dual-union which would seek to replace the UAW. The League of Revolutionary Black Workers eventually split between those who wanted to remain focused on the auto industry and those who wished to expand the League into a national political organization. The nationally oriented movement, led by General Baker, retained the organizational name the League and DRUM and was associated with the New Communist Movement. By 1975, however, the plant-level organization was largely defunct. Many members had been fired, and those who stayed often joined other currents in the union reform movement, such as the United National Caucus."

Located north of Bowling Green in Wood County, the site was inhabited by Middle Woodland and Upper Mississippian peoples.  Among the artifacts discovered at the site are ceramics and stone tools.  The site's stratigraphy is obvious: the Middle Woodland village site and cemetery can easily be distinguished from the Upper Mississippian occupation zone that sits on top of it.  While only a small portion of the 2.2 acre (0.89 ha) site has been excavated, the artifacts that have been discovered at Dodge have contributed significantly to an understanding of the western basin of Lake Erie around AD 1300.  Enough material has been recovered to facilitate radiometric dating, as well as identifying the peoples who once inhabited the site.  The excavations also revealed the intensity of occupation: the Middle Woodland layer was substantially larger than the exceptionally thin Upper Mississippian component.In 1978, the National Park Service recognized the Dodge Site's archaeological value by listing it on the National Register of Historic Places.  Five years later, owners Henry Dodge and his wife donated the site to The Archaeological Conservancy in the interests of preservation."

The Tomahawk attracted significant press and industry attention for its striking design, its outsize-displacement, 10-cylinder car engine, and its four close-coupled wheels, which give it a motorcycle-like appearance. Experts disagreed on whether it is a true motorcycle. The Retro-Art Deco design's central visual element is the 500-horsepower (370 kW), 8.3-litre (510 cu in) V10 SRT10 engine from the Dodge Viper sports car. The Tomahawk's two front and two rear wheels are sprung independently, which would allow it to lean into corners and countersteer like a motorcycle.Dodge press releases and spokespeople gave various hypothetical top speeds ranging from 300 mph (480 km/h) to as high as 420 mph (680 km/h), which analysts thought were probably calculated with horsepower and final drive ratio alone, without accounting for drag, rolling resistance, and stability. These estimates, and the more conservative 250 mph (400 km/h) a designer suggested could be possible, were debunked as implausible, or physically impossible, by the motorcycling and automotive media. No independent road tests of the Tomahawk have ever been published, and the company said that in internal testing it was never ridden above 100 mph (160 km/h). The Tomahawk was sold through the Neiman Marcus catalog at a price of US$555,000, and as many as nine are thought to have been have sold. As they were not street legal, Dodge said the reproductions were  ""automotive sculpture"", ""intended for display only"" not fully operational.Industry observers said the Tomahawk was a resounding success at one-upping rivals and taking the trade show spotlight, and was a branding and marketing coup, generating media buzz and sending the message that Chrysler was a bold, ambitious company, unafraid to take risks."

From 1940 to early 1942, almost 82,400 of the 1⁄2‑ton 4×4 Dodge trucks were built — initially called the VC series, but the great majority (from 1941) in the WC series, and in more variants. Contrary to what Dodge's nomenclature suggested, the 1941 WC models were a direct evolution of the 1940 VC models, retaining the U.S. Army's G-505 Ordnance Corps Supply Catalog number.
In 1942, the payload was uprated, and the trucks became the shorter G-502, 3⁄4‑ton, 4×4 Truck (Dodge), and the longer 1943, G-507, 11⁄2‑ton, 6x6 personnel and cargo truck (Dodge) — confusingly retaining Dodge WC model codes. Although the 3⁄4‑tons featured significant design improvements, they did retain some 80% interchangeable components and service parts with the 1⁄2‑ton models — a vital Army requirement, for field maintenance and operability of the trucks.Dodge was the U.S. Army's main supplier of 1⁄2‑ton trucks, and its sole supplier of both 3⁄4‑ton trucks and 11⁄2‑ton 6x6 trucks in World War II. With over a quarter million units built through August 1945, the G-502 3⁄4‑tons were the most common variants in the WC‑series.
After the war, Dodge developed the 3⁄4-ton WC‑series into the civilian 4×4 Dodge Power Wagon; and in 1951, the WCs were replaced by the very similar 3⁄4‑ton 4x4 Dodge M-series vehicles .
Though the majority of Dodges built were 'Weapons Carriers', ""WC"" was not abbreviated from this, but a general Dodge model code – initially ""W"" for 1941, and ""C"" for a (nominal) half-ton payload rating. However, the ""WC"" model code was simply retained after 1941 — for both the 3⁄4-ton, as well as the 11⁄2‑ton rated 6x6 Dodges.
All in all, not counting mechanically related variants, the WC series alone involved 52 model versions (thirty 1⁄2‑ton 4×4, eight 1⁄2‑ton 4×2, twelve 3⁄4‑ton 4×4, and two 11⁄2‑ton 6×6 models). Creating vehicles of a common platform in such a variety of designs, with payloads ranging from 1⁄2‑ton to 11⁄2‑tons, had no equal in its time, and is seen as an extraordinary feat of the WWII American auto industry."
2463771.0,0,Dodge v. Ford Motor Co.,"Dodge v. Ford Motor Company, 204 Mich. 459, 170 N.W. 668 (Mich. 1919) is a case in which the Michigan Supreme Court held that Henry Ford had to operate the Ford Motor Company in the interests of its shareholders, rather than in a charitable manner for the benefit of his employees or customers. It is often incorrectly cited as affirming the principle of ""shareholder primacy"" in corporate America. At the same time, the case affirmed the business judgment rule, leaving Ford an extremely wide latitude about how to run the company.
In the 1950s and 1960s, states rejected Dodge repeatedly, in cases including AP Smith Manufacturing Co v. Barlow or Shlensky v. Wrigley. The general legal position today is that the business judgment that directors may exercise is expansive. Management decisions will not be challenged where one can point to any rational link to benefiting the corporation as a whole."

However, the seating layout was changed: while the 6 HP offered vis-à-vis seating, the 10 HP was a Phaeton with two rows of seats.
While the 8 HP was specifically developed for commercial use as a taxi, there still were few private buyers for automobiles.
Like the 6 HP model, the 10 HP had a 2-cylinder petrol engine with 1082 cc with two valves per cylinder. This allowed a maximum power of 10 PS. The drive was via a 3-speed manual transmission with chain drive on the rear wheels.  While a steering wheel (instead of a tiller bar) was only available as an option for the 6 HP, it was standard on the 10 HP. The price for a 10 HP with standard equipment amounted to 9,000 Italian lira. Probably due to the increase in consumption due to the higher weight the model was not a success for Fiat.
