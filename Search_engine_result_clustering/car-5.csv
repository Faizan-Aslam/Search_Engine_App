Measuring only 3.22 m (10 ft 7 in) long, its all-new design was the first unibody and rear-engined Fiat, and was priced the equivalent of about €6,700 or US$7300 in today's money (590,000 lire then). The total number produced from 1955 to 1969 at the Mirafiori plant in Turin was 2,695,197.The 1955 Fiat 600 formed the blueprint for the 2nd generation ""Nuova"" (New) 500, launched two years later – which was even smaller, at 2.97 m (9 ft 9 in) and, although rounder, largely copied the 600s layout and shape. Later, the 600 also formed the platform for the larger 850 saloon, launched in 1964, which coexisted with the 600 in Fiats line-up for five years, until the 600 was cancelled.

41366606.0,0,Fiat 615,"Fiat 615 was a model of Fiat light truck manufactured from 1951 to 1953 as a successor to the Fiat 1100ELR, with which was still built in parallel. It had a total weight of 3,100 kg (6,834 lb), and was available in versions stake or van bodywork, chassis and carrozable for transportation and as a tractocamioón. Its cabin was the most Graned made by Fiat, and was inspired by the Model 640.
At first the model had a new petrol engine with 1395 cc and 29 kW (39 hp) at 3800 rpm to 1400 Fiat, and had a manual 4-speed transmission. A 1.5 ton truck was newly developed, which was offered from 1951 in a flatbed and chassis for special bodies. It was powered by the engine of the prior year featured Fiat 1400s. The engine was already in the car Fiat 1400 was just sufficient, and with the 3.1 tons it had real trouble. Once in motion, the Fiat 615 was indeed 80 km/h (50 mph) fast, but with forced driving it had poor fuel efficiency. There was a reason that the 1100 Fiat ELR far built until 1954. The somewhat weaker beast of burden was, with its 1.1 liter and 28/30 PS (at 4400 rpm) a little lame, but it had fully loaded a ton to move less weight, so was more economical. It therefore retained its loyal following who forgave its manageable liveliness out of habit, especially as it came with start-up to a peak of over 90 km/h (56 mph) and thus was significantly faster than the Fiat 615 with its maximum of 78 km/h (48 mph). With high pressure, therefore a suitable diesel engine was developed by Fiat: a swirl chamber engine (Ricardo System) based on the 1.9 liter engine for the ""big"" Fiat in 1900 and the new SUV Fiat Campagnola. (This engine was a hubvergrößerte variant of the 1400 engine.) The new diesel engine (type 305) was later also available in either sedan 1400 from 1952 in addition to the Fiat 615 N (N = Nafta = Diesel) and one year in Fiat Campagnola and Fiat. Although the experiment of the Fiat 615 built 1.9 L gasoline engine proved to be stronger and with faster drive spurt, confined themselves to the diesel, the Type 615 N. Only Steyr in Austria until 1958 offered the Fiat 615 as gasoline, as Steyr 260 with its own 50 hp 2 L  gasoline engine from the car Steyr 2000. The Fiat 615 N was a very modern vehicle that in Italy, initially had no competition. The export ran well at the beginning, missing, or half-hearted development left the Fiat 615 N (and especially its successor) over the years become increasingly rare even in Italy. In Zastava in Yugoslavia, the Fiat 615 was built with a petrol engine under license. However, not as the beginning of the Fiat, with the 1.4 L 4-cylinder engine, but with the much stronger torque 1.9 liter engine (type 105) with 47 hp (35 kW) at 3500 rpm, as well as in the, also at Zastava built under license, Campagnola was used.

In 1939, the 626 was the first FIAT truck with forward control and it replaced the  models 621 and 633.
The initial version of the 626 for civilian use was the 626N (""N"" for Nafta, the Italian for diesel). This was followed by a slightly longer wheelbase version the 626NL (from Nafta Lungo - ""diesel long"").
The military version for the Italian Army and the Italian Air Force was the 626NLM (for Nafta Lungo Militare)
A reliable workhorse, the FIAT 626 became the standard Italian medium truck and operated on all fronts.
France ordered 1,650 trucks; 700 had been delivered by the time Italy declared war on June 10, 1940. After the Italian armistice with the Allies in September 1943, the FIAT 626 was used by German forces. By 31 January 1945 3,000 had been produced for German use. In 1941, 100 trucks were purchased by the Bulgarian army after Bulgaria became an ally of Germany and Italy. The Bulgarian Army still used the vehicles in 1944–1945, after the country signed an armistice with the Allies' and participated in the war against Germany.
Production finished in 1948, after 10,000 Fiat 626 had been produced at FIAT's Turin assembly lines.

The Fiat 8V got its name because at the time of its making, Fiat believed Ford had a copyright on ""V8"". With 114 made, the 8V wasn't a commercial success, but did well in racing. Apart from the differential the car did not share any parts with the other Fiats (but many parts were made by Siata and they used them for their cars). The 8V was developed by Dante Giacosa and the stylist Luigi Rapi. The engine was a V8 originally designed for a luxury sedan, but that project was stopped.
The Fiat V8 had a 70 degree V configuration, displaced 1,996 cc and was fitted with two twin-choke Weber 36 DCF 3 carburettors. In its first iteration (type 104.000) the engine had a compression ratio of 8.5:1 and produced 105 PS (77 kW; 104 hp) at 5,600 rpm, giving the car a top speed of 190 km/h (118 mph). Improved type 104.003 had different camshaft timing for 115 PS (85 kW; 113 hp) at 6,000 rpm; finally type 104.006 with an 8.75:1 compression ratio, revised camshaft timing and fuel system put out 127 PS (93 kW; 125 hp) at 6,600 rpm.
The engine was connected to a four speed gearbox. The car had independent suspension all round and drum brakes on all four wheels.

1664270.0,0,Fiat BR.20 Cicogna,"The Fiat BR.20 Cicogna (Italian: ""stork"") was a low-wing twin-engine medium bomber that was developed and manufactured by Italian aircraft company Fiat. It holds the distinction of being the first all-metal Italian bomber to enter service; at the time, it was regarded as one of the most modern medium bombers in the world.The BR.20 has its origins in a request by the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Royal Air Force) issued during 1934 for a new medium bomber capable of high speeds, long range, and satisfactory payload, reliability, and flight characteristics compared to contemporaries. Among the companies that chose to respond was Fiat, which completed its design for the competition during 1935. On 10 February 1936, the first prototype (serial number M.M.274) conducted its maiden flight. Flight testing proceeded at a rapid pace; during September 1936, initial deliveries of the type commenced to the Regia Aeronautica.
During summer 1937, the BR.20 received its baptism of fire when a number were operated by the Aviazione Legionaria during the Spanish Civil War; the BR-20 came to form the backbone of Nationalist bombing operations, along with the German-built Heinkel He 111. It was also used in combat during the 1930s with relative success by the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War. During 1939, a modified long-range BR.20 version (designated BR.20L) named Santo Francesco under the command of Maner Lualdi performed a highly publicised non-stop flight from Rome to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
Upon the entry of Italy into the Second World War during mid-1940, the BR.20 served as the standard medium bomber of the Regia Aeronautica, however, by that point, the type was already approaching obsolescence. By 1942, the aircraft was mostly used for maritime patrol and operational training for bomber crews. The BR.20 was produced from the mid-1930s until the end of the Second World War.

The CR.42 was an evolution  of Fiat’s earlier CR.32 fighter, featuring a more powerful supercharged Fiat A.74R1C.38 air-cooled radial engine and aerodynamic improvements to its relatively clean exterior surfaces. The aircraft proved to be relatively agile in flight, a factor that had been attributed to its very low wing loading and a sometimes decisive tactical advantage. RAF Intelligence praised its exceptional manoeuvrability, further noting that ""the plane was immensely strong"", though it was technically outclassed by faster, more heavily armed monoplanes. While primarily used as a fighter, various other roles were adopted for some variants of the type, such as the CR.42CN night-fighter model, the CR.42AS ground-attack aircraft, and the CR.42B Biposto twin-seat trainer aircraft.
During May 1939, the CR.42 entered service with the Regia Aeronautica; it was the last of the Fiat biplane fighters to enter front line service. By 10 June 1940, the date when Italy entered the Second World War, roughly 300 of the type had been delivered, which defended metropolitan cities and important military installations at first. By the end of 1940, the Falco had been involved in combat on various fronts, including the Battle of France, the Battle of Britain, Malta, North Africa, and Greece. By the end of the war, Italian CR.42s had been used on further fronts, including Iraq, the Eastern Front and the Italian mainland. Following the signing of the Italian armistice with the Allies on 8 September 1943, the type was relegated to use as a trainer by the Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force, while some Italian CR.42s were seized by the Germans and used by the Luftwaffe to perform ground-attack operations.
The CR.42 was produced and entered service in smaller numbers with the air forces of other nations, including Belgium, Sweden and Hungary. By the end of production, in excess of 1,800 CR.42s has been constructed, making it the most numerous Italian aircraft to be used during the Second World War.

The G.50 commonly came up against the British Hawker Hurricane, which was fast enough to frequently outrun the Italian opponent, and could also outrange it. In addition, early in the Second World War it became apparent that the G.50 possessed inadequate armament, comprising a pair of Breda-SAFAT 12.7-mm machine guns. Later models of the fighter incorporated improvements, including an increase in fuel capacity that gave rise to a substantial increase in range.
The G.50 was exported to several overseas customers, small numbers being flown by the Croatian Air Force while 35 G.50 fighters were shipped to Finland, where they served with distinction during both the Winter War of 1939–1940 and the Continuation War of 1941–1944 against the Soviet Union.

The Fiat G.55 was arguably the best type produced in Italy during World War II, (a subjective claim also frequently made for the Macchi C.205 Veltro as well as for the Reggiane Re.2005 Sagittario) but it did not enter production until 1943, when, after comparative tests against the Messerschmitt Bf 109G and the Focke-Wulf 190, the Luftwaffe itself regarded the Fiat G.55 as ""the best Axis fighter"".During its short operational service, mostly under the Repubblica Sociale Italiana insignia, after the 8 September 1943 armistice, this powerful, robust and fast aircraft proved itself to be an excellent interceptor at high altitude. In 1944, over Northern Italy, the Centauro clashed with British Supermarine Spitfire, P-51 Mustang, P-47 Thunderbolt and P-38 Lightning, proving to be no easy adversary.  Italian fighter pilots liked their Centauro but by the time the war ended, fewer than 300 had been built. By comparison, the Germans produced 35,000 Bf 109s.",

Over the years, Fiat has acquired numerous other automakers: it acquired Lancia in 1968, became a shareholder of Ferrari in 1969, took control of Alfa Romeo from the Italian government in 1986, purchased Maserati in 1993, and became the full owner of Chrysler Group LLC in 2014. Fiat Group currently produces vehicles under twelve brands: Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Dodge, Ferrari, Fiat, Fiat Professional, Jeep, Lancia, Maserati, Ram Trucks, and SRT.
In 1970, Fiat employed more than 100,000 in Italy when its production reached the highest number, 1.4 million cars, in that country. As of 2002, Fiat built more than 1 million vehicles at six plants in Italy and the country accounted for more than a third of the company's revenue.Fiat-brand cars are built in several locations around the world. Outside Italy, the largest country of production is Brazil, where the Fiat brand is the market leader. The group also has factories in Argentina, Poland and Mexico (where Fiat-brand vehicles are manufactured at plants owned and operated by Chrysler for export to the U.S., Brazil, Italy and other markets) and a long history of licensing manufacture of its products in other countries. It also has numerous alliances and joint ventures around the world, the main ones being located in Serbia, France, Turkey, India and China.
Gianni Agnelli, the grandson of founder Giovanni Agnelli, was Fiat's chairman from 1966 until 1996; he then served as honorary chairman from 1996 until his death on 24 January 2003, during which time Cesare Romiti served as chairman. He was succeeded briefly by Paolo Fresco, who served as chairman, and Paolo Cantarella, as CEO. Umberto Agnelli then took over as chairman from 2003 to 2004. After Umberto Agnelli's death on 28 May 2004, Luca Cordero di Montezemolo was named chairman, with Agnelli heir John Elkann becoming vice chairman (at the age of 28), and other family members also serving on the board. On 1 June 2004, Giuseppe Morchio was replaced by Sergio Marchionne as CEO.",

In the early 20th century Fiat was heavily involved in racing to promote the reliability and mechanical fortitude of their brand. It was not uncommon for the early four-cylinder engines to displace over ten liters; many reaching into the 20-liter range. For Fiat, they too found provenance in expanding their engines. Their answer in the 1904 Gordon Bennett Cup race, an early type of ""Grand Prix"" racing, was the S74; a 75-horsepower racer which displaced fourteen liters from its four-cylinder engine.
It was first raced by Vincenzo Lancia (the future founder of the Lancia Company) and Fiat's works driver. He drove in the 1903 Paris-Madrid race, two US Vanderbilt Cup races, Multiple Grand Prix races, and possibly more. The 1912 French Grand Prix was arguably the best showing for the S74 then eight years old. Fiat had their S74 racer in the hands of many including David Bruce-Brown who was in the lead for much of the race. He was disqualified for refueling away from the pits. Ralph De Palma, also driving a S74, was as well disqualified from the race due to repairs performed outside of the pits.

The project took a long period of planning, studies began in 1948 and ended with a first track test on 14 April 1954 on the rooftop track of the Lingotto factory.
The car was first publicly shown on 23 April 1954 at the Turin-Caselle Airport, where it made some demonstration runs with Fiat chief test driver Carlo Salamano at the wheel. All major Fiat personalities were present, including Gianni Agnelli, president Vittorio Valletta and engineer Dante Giacosa, director of the technical office and responsible for the car's development. The Turbina was then displayed at the ongoing 36th Turin Motor Show.The turbine engine was placed amidships, behind the passenger compartment. It consisted of a two-stage centrifugal compressor, three can-type combustors, a two-stage turbine driving the compressor, and a single-stage power turbine with a geared reduction to the rear wheels. There were no gearbox or clutch. According to the manufacturer the engine produced 300 PS (220 kW; 300 hp) at 22,000 rpm, and the estimated top speed was approximately 250 km/h (160 mph). The bodywork had undergone wind tunnel testing at the Politecnico di Torino facilities, with tests showing a drag coefficient of Cd=0.14 on a one-fifth scale model of the car. By comparison, a 2017 Tesla Model 3 has a drag coefficient of Cd=0.23.The concept was shelved due to high fuel usage and problems with overheating.

22156522.0,0,Fiat money,"Fiat money (from Latin: fiat, ""let it be done"") is a type of money that is not backed by any commodity such as gold or silver, and typically declared by a decree from the government to be legal tender. Throughout history, fiat money was sometimes issued by local banks and other institutions. In modern times, fiat money is generally established by government regulation. 
Fiat money does not have intrinsic value and does not have use value. It has value only because the people who use it as a medium of exchange agree on its value. They trust that it will be accepted by merchants and other people. 
Fiat money is an alternative to commodity money, which is a currency that has intrinsic value because it contains a precious metal such as gold or silver which is embedded in the coin. Fiat also differs from representative money, which is money that has intrinsic value because it is backed by and can be converted into a precious metal or another commodity. Fiat money can look similar to representative money (such as paper bills), but the former has no backing, while the latter represents a claim on a commodity (which can be redeemed to a greater or lesser extent).Government-issued fiat money banknotes were used first during the 11th century in China. Fiat money started to predominate during the 20th century. Since President Richard Nixon's decision to decouple the US dollar from gold in 1971, a system of national fiat currencies has been used globally.
Fiat money can be:

Any money that is not backed by a commodity.
Money declared by a person, institution or government to be legal tender,  meaning that it must be accepted in payment of a debt in specific circumstances.
State-issued money which is neither convertible through a central bank to anything else nor fixed in value in terms of any objective standard.
Money used because of government decree.
An otherwise non-valuable object that serves as a medium of exchange (also known as fiduciary money.)The term fiat derives from the Latin word fiat, meaning ""let it be done"" used in the sense of an order, decree or resolution.",
38599727.0,0,Fiatallis,"Fiatallis (1983 to early 2000s, Fiat-Allis 1974 to 1982), was a brand of heavy equipment (also called construction equipment, earthmoving equipment, or engineering vehicles), such as loaders, bulldozers, backhoes, scrapers, and graders. It began in January 1974, when Allis-Chalmers's construction equipment business was reorganized into a joint venture with Fiat SpA, which bought a 65% majority stake at the outset.Allis-Chalmers's construction equipment business was often unprofitable during the 1950s and 1960s. It faced stiff competition from companies such as Caterpillar, Case, International Harvester, Euclid, John Deere, Fiat MMT, and several others. The 1974 formation of a new company, Fiat-Allis Construction Machinery Inc., was essentially a divestment for Allis-Chalmers so that capital could be redirected to their other more profitable divisions.   
In December 1980, Fiat-Allis Construction Machinery Inc. announced they would be closing the former Tractomotive wheel loader factory in Deerfield, Illinois and transferring all wheel loader and grader production to their Springfield, Illinois factory.   
In 1983, the company was renamed Fiatallis with a new corporate logo, and about a year later the North American headquarters was relocated from Deerfield, Illinois to their parts depot in Carol Stream, Illinois. 
As the joint venture progressed, Fiat continued to invest in Fiat-Allis and Fiatallis much more than their partner Allis-Chalmers and eventually increased their ownership stake to 85% in the early 1980's. The two parent firms disagreed on decisions made about Fiatallis and Allis-Chalmers was struggling financially, so the joint venture was ended in November 1985 when Fiat bought out Allis-Chalmers's remaining minority stake.
In October 1985, Fiatallis closed their remaining North American factory in Springfield, Illinois and transferred all remaining production to their Italian and Brazilian factories.  
In 1986, Fiatallis and Hitachi formed a joint venture called Fiat-Hitachi Excavators S.p.A. to manufacture excavators in Italy.  
In January 1988, Fiat combined their Fiatallis construction equipment subsidiary and their Fiatagri S.p.A. agricultural equipment subsidiary into the new Fiat Geotech S.p.A. holding company.  
In July 1992, Fiat announced another joint venture between their Fiat Geotech subsidiary, and Hitachi Construction Machinery Company Limited that was called Fiat-Hitachi Construction Equipment S.p.A.  The joint venture with Hitachi yielded Fiat-Hitachi and Fiatallis construction machinery branding for different markets until 2002 when Hitachi terminated the agreement.
After Fiat S.p.A. purchased Case Corporation in 1999 and formed CNH, they eventually retired the Fiatallis brand within a few years in their remaining markets and merged the company's assets with others from Case and New Holland. CNH's construction equipment lines are called New Holland Construction and Case Construction Equipment.

23851017.0,0,Fiat–Shamir heuristic,"In cryptography, the Fiat–Shamir heuristic is a technique for taking an interactive proof of knowledge and creating a digital signature based on it. This way, some fact (for example, knowledge of a certain secret number) can be publicly proven without revealing underlying information. The technique is due to Amos Fiat and Adi Shamir (1986).
For the method to work, the original interactive proof must have the property of being public-coin, i.e. verifier's random coins are made public throughout the proof protocol.
The heuristic was originally presented without a proof of security; later, Pointcheval and Stern proved its security against chosen message attacks in the random oracle model, that is, assuming random oracles exist. This result was generalized to the quantum-accessible random oracle (QROM) by Don, Fehr, Majenz and Schaffner, and concurrently by Liu and Zhandry. In the case that random oracles do not exist, the Fiat–Shamir heuristic has been proven insecure by Shafi Goldwasser and Yael Tauman Kalai. The Fiat–Shamir heuristic thus demonstrates a major application of random oracles. 
More generally, the Fiat–Shamir heuristic may also be viewed as converting a public-coin interactive proof of knowledge into a non-interactive proof of knowledge. If the interactive proof is used as an identification tool, then the non-interactive version can be used directly as a digital signature by using the message as part of the input to the random oracle.",
9073909.0,0,FORDISC,"Before ForDisc, many anthropologists based their studies on museum skeletal collections such as the Hamann-Todd collection that is housed at Case Western Reserve in Cleveland, Ohio, and the Terry collection housed at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. These museum collections house skeletal remains that were amassed 50 to 100 years ago. Due to the age of these collections, their use in a medico-legal context did not produce accurate determination of the biological profile. ForDisc was forensic anthropologists' solution to this problem, and allowed for classification when some measurements are not available.A 2009 study found that even in favourable circumstances, FORDISC 3.0 can be expected to classify no more than 1 per cent of specimens with confidence."" In 2012 research presented at the 81st Annual Meeting of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists concluded that ForDisc ancestry determination was not always consistent, that the program does not perform to expectations and that it should be used with caution.

It was founded by theatre manager John T. Ford (also the owner of infamous Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. where President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated, April 14, 1865) and designed by architect James J. Gifford. The opera house/theatre opened to the public on October 2, 1871 with a show that included readings from Shakespeare's ""As You Like It"" as well as vocal and orchestral performances. Then owned by 1950s–60s era theatre magnate Morris A. Mechanic, it closed almost 93 years later with its last Broadway show from New York City, ""Something Funny Happened on the Way to the Forum"" in 1964. It was replaced three years later as the prime site for Baltimore live theatre patrons with the opening in the landmark of the new downtown redevelopment project of Charles Center, the starkly modernistic ""Brutalist"" architecture of the Morris A. Mechanic Theatre at the southwest corner of Charles and Baltimore Streets, four blocks to the east.The Ford Opera house was later the site of newspaper publisher of the New York Tribune, Horace Greeley's nomination as the Liberal Republican Party candidate from a split Republican Party for the 1872 American Presidential election versus regular Republican Party candidate, incumbent 18th President, Ulysses S. Grant and Democratic candidate Seymour, who was reelected.",

35282141.0,0,Ford's Hospital,"Ford's Hospital, Coventry, traditionally known as Grey Friars Hospital, is a grade I listed 16th century half-timbered almshouse in Greyfriars Lane, Coventry. It was founded by the merchant William Ford (or perhaps 'Fourd') in 1509 to provide accommodation for six elderly people: five men and one woman. Despite the earlier name of ""Grey Friars"", it bears no relationship to the Franciscan Order but was so named because of its location on Greyfriars Lane.Inside the building is a narrow courtyard (13 yd × 4 yd (11.9 m × 3.7 m)). It has been considered by historians and writers to be a particularly fine example of English domestic architecture of the period.Following Ford's death, the endowment was extended in 1517 to allow six places for couples to live together. In 1529, it was extended further to allow five more couples to stay. According to W. Hickling, a Coventry historian writing in 1846, it was by then serving forty women, each of whom received an allowance of three shillings and six pence per week.During the Coventry Blitz, the building was hit by German bombing, like many other parts of the city. A bomb dropped on 14 October 1940 killed the warden, a nurse and six residents. It was restored with original timbers between 1951 and 1953. The building is located on the site of a chapel within Greyfriars Friary. In 1940, John Bailey Shelton, a Coventry archaeologist discovered encaustic tiles typical of those found in a chapel. The building was built with a considerable amount of teak.In 2006 the building was used as a location for the episode of Doctor Who called The Shakespeare Code. In attempting to reconstruct the Globe Theatre, Shakespeare scholars have used Ford's Hospital to understand Elizabethan doorways.

27295380.0,0,Ford's Store,"Ford's Store is a historic general store located in the hamlet of Oak Hill in the town of Durham in Greene County, New York.  It was built in 1870 as a two-story commercial building in the Italianate style, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.  The restored storefront is composed of a recessed entry flanked by display windows. John Bonafide, preservation analyst from the New York State Parks Commission, said of the building, “As constructed, Ford’s Store is a representative example of Italianate style commercial architecture, popular in America during the third quarter of the nineteenth century. Built on the site of an earlier store and harness shop, the building is architecturally significant as an intact example of simple, mid-nineteenth century commercial architecture in the hamlet of Oak Hill. Today, the Ford’s Store building is one of two intact commercial storefronts to survive in the community. Despite years of neglect and damage, Ford’s store, as restored, survives with a high degree of its architectural integrity.” Emerson Ford was the first of the Ford family to handle general merchandise there in partnership with G. M. Hallenbeck in 1875 as Ford and Hallenbeck. Emerson Ford had two sons, Ernest E. and N. Dwight. Ernest E. came into the business in 1898 with the help of his wife, Bertie Conran. Emerson’s other son, N. Dwight, married Millie B. Mackey and moved to Nebraska, where they had a son named Theodore Leo. Leo helped at the store during the summers of 1925 to 1926 before coming to work there full time in 1928. He became a partner of Ernest in 1931, and the store was then known as Ford and Ford. The last of the Fords to enter the business were George and Lionel, sons of Leo, and together with their father and great uncle they worked in the store until illness forced Ernest into retirement in the late 1950s. 
At that time Ralph Brand took over the store. A newspaper article recounts: “Ralph Brand has purchased stock, fixtures and merchandise of Fords’ store and will rent the building. Oak Hill post office will continue to occupy a portion of the store and will be operated by Leo and George Ford and Gledon Hulbert. Ralph will operate the store with Mrs. George Ford as his assistant.” Kenneth Brand, Ralph’s son, remembers: “My father ran the Ford store in the late 1950’s. I used to play around the store when I was a kid. Behind the store there used to be a shed. The shed had an outhouse in it, and the outhouse extended out over the Catskill creek. No flushing was required. Not very environmentally friendly, but that’s the way things were done back then. John Cords ran it for a few years after my father gave it up. I would guess that it closed around 1966 or 1967.” Sometime after that, the front windows were removed to install garage doors to allow the space to be used for auto repairs and storage.  
The building was restored in the 1990s, when the original components of the façade were found intact in the basement of the building and reinstalled. For a time, George Stevens ran a business called The Electric Farm out of the building, selling plants, especially African violets, that were grown under lights. Later the building was used as an annex of DeWitt Hotel Antiques, and then as a bookstore run by Fari Raad of Cornwallville. A record store, Dope Jams, which operated in Brooklyn from 2006 to 2012, was next to occupy the space. Dope Jams had been called “one of the best record stores on the East Coast.” The store, owned by Paul Nickerson, was decorated “like Aleister Crowley’s library” and carried house, dance, disco music, classic hip-hop, and techno. In 2020 the building was painted a solid charcoal gray when poet Kostas Anagnopoulos took over the space as Pidgin, selling antique furniture and objects with select contemporary items. Kostas said of the store, ""A pidgin is a simplified form of communication; an informal language, often developed in trade, allowing those from different backgrounds to convey thoughts to one another. I like to think of the objects in my store, with their quiet presence and shared appeal, as both the medium and the message.""",
408213.0,0,Ford's Theatre,"Ford's Theatre is a theater located in Washington, D.C., which opened in August 1863. It is infamous for being the site of the assassination of United States President Abraham Lincoln on April 14, 1865. After being shot in the head, the fatally wounded 56-year-old Lincoln was carried across the street to the Petersen House, where he died the next morning.
The theater was later used as a warehouse and office building, and in 1893 part of it collapsed, causing 22 deaths. It was renovated and re-opened as a theater in 1968. During the 2000s, it was renovated again, opening on February 12, 2009, in commemoration of the bicentennial of Lincoln's birth.  A related Center for Education and Leadership museum experience opened February 12, 2012, next to Petersen House.
The Petersen House and the theater are preserved together as Ford's Theatre National Historic Site, administered by the National Park Service; programming within the theater and the Center for Education is overseen separately by the Ford's Theatre Society.",

12158938.0,0,Ford (surname),"The surname Ford has several origins. In some cases it originated as a name for someone who lived near a ford, and is therefore derived from the Old English and Middle English ford. In some cases, the surname is derived from places named Ford. Examples of such places include Ford in Northumberland (from Old English ford), a place in Somerset, Ford in Shropshire (from Old English ford), Ford in West Sussex (from Old English ford), and Forde in Dorset.In other cases, the surname is sometimes an anglicised form of three Irish surnames. Two such surnames are Mac Giolla na Naomh, a name meaning ""son of Gilla na Naomh""; and Mac Conshámha, a name meaning ""son of Conshnámha"". These surnames were anglicised Ford because their final syllable was once erroneously thought to be the Irish áth (""ford""). Another Irish surname anglicised Ford is Ó Fuartháin, a name meaning ""descendant of Fuarthán"". The personal name Fuartháin, derived from the Irish fuar (""cold""), was once taken to represent the Irish fuarathán (""cold little ford""), which led the name to be erroneously translated ""ford"". The former two Irish surnames were borne by septs centred in the province of Connacht, whilst the latter was borne by a sept centred in County Cork (in the province of Munster).In some cases the surname Ford is an americanized form of like-sounding Jewish surnames, or else a translated form of the German Fürth. Early instances of the surname Ford include de la forda in the eleventh century, æt Fordan in the twelfth-century, de la Forthe in the thirteenth-century, and Foorde and de Furd in the fifteenth century. The surname Ford, when found in Ireland, may be of English or Irish origin since many Ford families have immigrated to Ireland at various times in history. For example, a particular noted family of the name in County Meath emigrated from Devon in the fourteenth century. In Ireland, birth records for the year 1890 reveal that the surname Ford was much less common than the variant Forde (154 births compared to only 39).",

It featured almost no chrome trim or luxury equipment and could be compared to the Chevrolet Biscayne in trim level.

Ford 300s were often used by police and taxi fleets, and had a base price of more than $100 less than comparable models in the base Galaxie series. However, private customers could also purchase one if low price and economy, with the convenience of a full-sized automobile were the prime objectives.

An interesting part of this car's history concerns the availability of the big-block FE-series V-8 engines, including the 425-hp 427 cubic inch unit.  Combined with manual transmission, these cars were often used as drag racers due to their light weight.

This engine family began production in late 1969 with a 351 cu in (5.8 L) engine, commonly called the 351C. It later expanded to include a 400 cu in (6.6 L) engine which used a taller version of the engine block, commonly referred to as a tall deck engine block, a 351 cu in (5.8 L) tall deck variant, called the 351M, and a 302 cu in (4.9 L) engine which was exclusive to Australia.

The Lima engines were used across multiple applications in North America.  In cars, the engines saw use by all three Ford divisions in full-size cars, intermediates, personal luxury cars, and muscle cars.  In trucks, the engine family was used in full-size trucks and vans, along with medium and heavy-duty trucks.
Produced in Lima, Ohio (Lima Engine), the engine family was the final big-block V8 designed and produced by Ford during the 20th century.  After 1978, the engines were phased out of Ford cars as its full-size cars underwent downsizing (intermediates last used the engines in 1976).  Following its shift to truck use, the Lima engines were joined by multiple diesel-powered engines.
In 1997, Ford introduced the overhead-cam Triton V10, which replaced the Lima V8 engine family after the 1998 model year; the next overhead-valve large-block V8 produced by Ford is the 7.3L ""Godzilla"" V8 introduced for 2020.

4162614.0,0,Ford 4F27E transmission,"The 4F27E is an electronically controlled 4-speed automatic transaxle transmission developed by Mazda and Ford.
Mazda's name for this transmission is FN4A-EL, Ford's name for this transmission is 4F27E.
Mazda's FS5A-EL (Ford FNR5) is the 5-speed successor to this transmission which shares many of the same parts.
The 4F27E is a strengthened 4-speed F-4EAT automatic and only some of the internals were updated. It now has a four-element torque converter that includes a torque converter clutch and geartrain with two planetary gearsets, a transfer-shaft gear final drive, and a larger differential. The hydraulic control system of the 4F27E has six electronically controlled solenoids for shift feel (through line pressure control), shift scheduling (through shift valve position control) and TCC (torque converter clutch) apply, controlled by pulse-width modulation (PWM). 
On Mazda vehicles, this transmission uses Mazda M5 fluid (Mazda part number: 0000-77-112E-01), which is NOT Mercon V or Mercon LV according to Mazda Technical Service Bulletin 0500116. This fluid is made by Idemitsu Kosan (according to the label on the back of the Mazda bottle). Idemitsu sells the equivalent Type-M fluid in the aftermarket.
The equivalent Ford fluid is FNR5 (Ford part number: XT-9-QMM5).
Moreover, Mazda vehicles have ""M V"" written on the dipstick handle.
On the other hand, Ford cars used Mercon V (Ford part number: XT-5-QMC) until 2007 MY. After 2007 Ford made some hardware and calibration modifications so that from 2008 MY it is required to use Mercon LV oil (Ford part number: XT-10-QLVC). Later Ford authorized back servicing transmissions from 2000 to 2007 with Mercon LV.
Differences between Ford Mercon ATF and Mazda type M5 ATF:

Mazda type M5 ATF is not the same fluid as Ford Mercon V or  Ford Mercon LV.
Mazda type M5 ATF has a greater viscosity than Ford Mercon V and Ford Mercon LV in low temperatures.
Mazda type M5 ATF has a greater anti-judder specification than Ford Mercon V and Ford Mercon LV.Consequently, carefully refer to the service manual for correct transmission maintenance as Ford and Mazda made their own calibration modification on the transmission so mixing different oils or servicing transmission with the wrong fluid will result in premature wear and transmission damage.
Mazda includes a drain plug, while Ford does not. For the Ford vehicles without the drain plug, a Mazda transmission pan can be installed on a Ford 4F27E, and it will fit perfectly. Aftermarket transmission pans are also available.

The 6R80 is featured in 2009 to present Ford F-150 pickups. It features torque converter lockup capabilities in all 6 gears and an integrated ""Tow/Haul"" mode for enhanced engine braking and towing performance. For the 2011 model year, the transmission was revised to provide smoother shifts, improved fuel economy, and overall better shift performance. Most notable of the improvements was the addition of a 1 way clutch that provided smoother 1-2 up-shifts and 2-1 down-shifts. The transmission has a relatively low 1st gear and two overdrive gears, the highest of which is 0.69:1. This provides exceptional towing performance when needed, while maximizing fuel economy by offering low engine speeds while cruising.
The 6R80 can be found behind the 3.7L V-6 all the way up to the 6.2L V-8.

One ACT system was installed as a part of a Ford-funded real estate development near their headquarters in Dearborn, MI, and although they proposed to install ACT in several other locations, no additional systems were ever installed and the project was put on indefinite hold.",

28616592.0,0,Ford A series,"The Ford A series is a range of trucks that was built by Ford UK to bridge the gap between the relatively small Transit of 3.5 metric tonnes GVW and the bigger 7-tonne D series.

In 1967, Ford made the decision to carry out a thorough investigation of the sector of 3.5 to 7 ton GVW trucks.
The decision to introduce the range was made in 1970 and development began in early 1971.
Public debut for the A series was at the Frankfurt Motor Show 1973.
Some 20 vehicles running over 500 000 miles were used during the three-year, 12 million-pound proving and development programme.
The A series was commercially first introduced on September 13, 1973.
Over 350 basic variants were built, allowing for wheelbase, gross weight, engine and body types, and also LHD and RHD.
Even an articulated tractor or ""baby"" artic, the AA0709 with a GCW of 6600 kg was added to the range but only sold in the UK.
The ""A"" cab shared most components with the Transit and the most notable differences are the longer and wider wings, longer hood and a different grille.
Unlike the Transit that had a face lift in 1977/1978 the ""A"" retained its profile for the entire period of production. 
The A series could be divided into two categories:

The smaller A04xx with 14-inch wheels, 6x170 mm bolt pattern, and four-cylinder engines.
The bigger A05xx / A06xx with 16-inch wheels, 6×205 mm bolt pattern, stronger frame and six-cylinder engines.Four different engines were offered: a 2.4l 4-cylinder diesel. A 3.54l 6-cylinder diesel, actually a 2.4 with 2 more cylinders, a 2l V4 petrol and a 3l V6 petrol.

521153.0,0,Ford C. Frick Award,"The Ford C. Frick Award is presented annually by the National Baseball Hall of Fame in the United States to a broadcaster for ""major contributions to baseball"". It is named for Ford C. Frick, former Commissioner of Major League Baseball. Before his career as an executive, Frick was a baseball writer; he gained fame as the ghostwriter for Babe Ruth in the 1920s. The award was created in 1978, and named in tribute to Frick following his death that year.
Though they are sometimes erroneously referred to as ""Hall of Famers"", honorees are not inducted into the Hall of Fame. Honorees (if living) give a speech at the Hall of Fame during induction weekend, and their names are added to a plaque in the Hall's library. For several years in the early 2000s, Frick Award honorees also became life members of the Veterans Committee, which considers candidates for Hall of Fame induction who are not eligible for the regular voting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America – specifically, players no longer on the BBWAA ballot and all non-players. However, starting with the 2008 elections, voting for players on the main Veterans Committee ballot was restricted to Hall of Fame members. After further changes announced for the 2011 elections, Frick Award winners are eligible to serve on the voting bodies that replaced the Veterans Committee (currently four) that consider candidates from different eras of baseball.
From 2004 to 2016, fans were allowed to vote for three of the award's ten annual nominees; in the final years of fan voting, it was conducted on the Hall's Facebook page. Through 2013, seven candidates were selected by a committee consisting of previous Frick Award winners and broadcast historians and columnists, which also determined the final recipient. Beginning with the 2014 award, the final election committee no longer selects any of the finalists; that role is now handled by a Hall of Fame research committee.Other changes in the selection process were also announced for the 2014 award; these changes were similar to those instituted in 2010 for Veterans Committee balloting. From 2014 to 2016, candidates were considered every third year, based on the era in which they made their most significant contributions:
""High Tide Era"": Mid-1980s to present, including the rise of regional cable networks. Individuals from this era were considered for the 2014 award.
""Living Room Era"": Mid-1950s to early 1980s, reflecting the rise of television. Individuals from this era were considered for the 2015 award.
""Broadcasting Dawn Era"": Origin of broadcasting to early 1950s. Individuals from this era were first considered for the 2016 award.More recently, the Hall announced further changes to the selection process in 2016 that took effect immediately, with the first award affected by these changes being that for 2017. Fan voting was eliminated, and the final ballot was cut from 10 to 8. Candidates are still considered every third year, but now in mostly different categories:
""Current Major League Markets"": Broadcasters who made their mark with one or more specific MLB teams. These individuals were first considered for the 2017 award.
""National Voices"": Broadcasters who made their contributions with national media. These individuals were first considered for the 2018 award.
""Broadcasting Beginnings"": Pioneers of baseball broadcasting, roughly covering the time span of the previous ""Broadcasting Dawn Era"". These individuals were first considered for the 2019 award.

Five cars are known to have been built. Although the cars were often very quick in qualifying (when they had been fully developed), reliability problems plagued them, and restricted their successes to two Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft victories in 1982, and a single Thundersports victory in 1983. Following the end of Ford's involvement in the C100 project in 1983, Zakspeed modified one of the chassis into the C1/4, which used a 1.8-litre turbocharged in-line 4 from their Group 5 Ford Capri. The C100 was also evolved into the Zakspeed C1/8, which used the 4-litre Cosworth DFL in a C1/4 chassis.

The Bordeaux Automatic Transmission Plant, in Blanquefort, France (in the Bordeaux metropolitan area) produces automatic transmissions for a variety of rear-wheel drive vehicles. The facility opened in 1973 and was shortly followed by an expansion, the Bordeaux Transaxle Plant, in 1976 to focus on automatic transmissions for front-wheel drive Fords. Bordeaux Automatic Transmission's first product was the C3 3-speed automatic transmission for the Ford Pinto. The C3 design was succeeded by the A4LD 4-speed automatic during the mid-1980s and was in turn succeeded by the 4R44 and 4R55 4-speed automatics during the mid-1990s. The Bordeaux Automatic Transmission Plant's current products are the 5R44 and 5R55 5-speed automatic transmissions.
In February 2009, Ford confirmed its intent to sell the Bordeaux Automatic Transmission Plant for an undisclosed sum to a French company, HZ Holding France SAS, which owns a steel forging operation near Metz. Though the sale will be completed as early as April 2009, the plant will continue to provide transmissions for Ford until 2011 and employment levels at the plant are expected to remain unchanged. Up to and after the production of automatic transmissions for Ford at the Bordeaux plant, HZ Holding expects to invest as much as 200 million Euros in the plant for new industrial projects, including producing components for wind turbines. The 5R55N was built in Sharonville Ohio transmission plant. Not Bordeaux.  Once the LS and T bird switched to the 5R55S it was the Bordeaux built transmission.

2631966.0,0,Ford C4 transmission,"The Ford C4 is a three-speed, medium-duty automatic transmission introduced on 1964 model year vehicles and produced through 1981. The C4 was designed to be a lighter and simpler replacement for the original Ford-O-Matic two speed transmission being used in smaller, less powerful cars.
Ford used the term ""SelectShift"" because in the first C4's, placing the gear selector in D2 forced the transmission to start in second gear and then shift to third gear. If the transmission was placed in D1, the transmission would start in first gear, then shift to second and third gear as normal. If the gear selector was placed into L, the transmission stayed in first gear only. The shifter display appeared as P-R-N-D2-D1-L. Because this was confusing, later versions of the C4 were changed to a P-R-N-D-2-1 (or L) pattern typically seen today.
Because of its cast iron construction, the Ford-O-Matic was very heavy.  In designing the C4, Ford used an aluminum alloy, three-piece case (bell housing, main case, and tailhousing).  The aluminum case and the use of a simpler Simpson planetary gearset reduced the weight significantly. It was primarily used with Ford's inline six-cylinder engines and small V8 engines (see Ford Windsor engines), usually up to 302 in³ (5.0 L).  By comparison, the 351 Windsor and 351 Cleveland small and intermediate-block engines were backed by the medium-duty FMX or the heavy-duty C6 that debuted in 1966. Some C4s were built with a larger spread bell housing to use with 351M V8s, but these are rare. A few were also used with FE engines, mostly the 390 in full-size cars. Ratios are 2.46 low, 1.46 second and direct high. 
The early model C4 (1964–1969) used a .788-inch 24-spline input shaft, which was upgraded in 1970 to 26-spline and .839-inch.  The upgrade also included a matching 26-spline clutch hub.  In 1971, Ford went to a 26/24-spline input shaft, meaning the torque-converter side is 26-spline and the clutch hub is 24-spline.
The C4 was also found with valve bodies requiring a different number of bolts, 8-bolt vs 9-bolt.  A 9-bolt valve body can be used in either case, but a nut & bolt must be used on the valve body in the empty hole, dropping the bolt in from the top and using the nut on the bottom/filter side.
Modified C4s remain popular with hot rodders and drag racers due to their simplicity and durability.

Compared to its predecessor MX transmission, the C6 offered lower weight, less complexity, less parasitic power loss, and greater torque capacity for larger engines. It did this without exceeding the packaging dimensions of the MX. These design goals were in line with those of the C4 for smaller engines. It was given the name ""SelectShift"" because if the transmission was placed in first or second gear, the transmission would use only the gear selected (i.e. would immediately activate that gear rather than initiating a sequence of shifts to arrive at it), whether from a standing stop or in motion. This was very helpful when driving in limited traction situations, where the torque of the engine would gradually move the vehicle, or if engine braking was needed on a downward incline. Once the transmission was placed in third, all three gears would be used in a normal fashion.",

1048718.0,0,Ford CHT engine,"The Ford CHT (Compound High Turbulence) engine is an inline four-cylinder internal combustion engine produced by the Ford Motor Company in Brazil during the 1980s and 1990s. It is unrelated to the similarly-named CVH engine.
The CHT was introduced in 1984 in the Mark 3 Escort, the first of the series to be released in Brazil. It was later used in the Ford Del Rey and the Verona (a Brazilian Orion), as well as the Volkswagen Gol.
This engine was based on the Renault Cléon-Fonte engine introduced in 1962. Ford do Brasil inherited this engine upon buying the Brazilian Willys/Renault operation in the late 1960s. It has overhead valves (two per cylinder) and features a rotating valve design. The displacement of the original Cléon-Fonte used in the Ford Corcel was 1,289 cc (78.7 cu in) from a 73 mm × 77 mm (2.87 in × 3.03 in) bore and stroke; this was later raised to 1,372 cc (83.7 cu in) 75.32 mm × 77 mm (2.97 in × 3.03 in) for the ""XP"" engine (later called ""1300-B"" in single-carburetted form).The Cléon-Fonte was finally increased to 1,555 cc (94.9 cu in) (77 mm × 83.5 mm (3.03 in × 3.29 in)) in 1979, a displacement which the CHT would inherit. Ford do Brasil used the Cléon-Fonte engine until 1983, when they made a thorough redesign to the head and renamed it CHT. There was also a smaller 1,341 cc (81.8 cu in) version with a 71.5 mm (2.81 in) bore. The Corcel-derived Pampa pickup truck also used the Cléon-Fonte engine until replaced with the CHT in 1984.The goal of the redesign was to create an internal turbulence in the combustion chambers to promote more complete combustion. The resulting unit was robust and economical, albeit with modest performance compared to the competing Volkswagen EA-827. The CHT has lower peak power output but with generally higher average torque, with the torque curve being much flatter and closer to the maximum at any engine speed. Torque was the CHT engine's advantage, it being capable of running without much loss of power in very low engine speeds as well.It was also available to run on ethanol.Three models were originally available:

1.6 petrol 65 hp (48 kW)
1.6 ethanol 74 hp (55 kW)
1.6 XR ethanol 83 hp (62 kW) for the Escort XR3Later, the engine was tuned for better power figures and fuel efficiency:

1.6 petrol 74 hp (55 kW)
1.6 ethanol 86 hp (64 kW)In 1987, with the release of the Mark 4 Ford Escort, this engine benefited from some revisions, resulting in the CHT E-Max (maximised economy) version. All the new models featured better torque. This, the second generation CHT engine received the award of most economical engine of its time in Brazil, capable of running 17.1 km/L (48 mpg‑imp; 40 mpg‑US) of petrol.
In March 1992, a smaller version with a 70.3 mm × 64.2 mm (2.77 in × 2.53 in) bore and stroke for a displacement of 997 cc (60.8 cu in) was released. It was installed in both the Escort Hobby and the Volkswagen Gol:

1.0 petrol 50 hp (37 kW).During the Autolatina period (1987–1996) Volkswagen used this engine, naming it AE-1600 and AE-1000 when fitted to VWs - but this is largely the same engine. AE stands for Alta Economia (High Economy). In 1996 and 1997 the CHT was gradually replaced. In Volkswagens, the AE-1000 was replaced by the EA111 and the AE-1600 by the EA827. In Fords, the CHT was replaced either by the newer Zetec-SE 16-valve unit or the older Kent Endura-E.",

Engines were built in the Dearborn Engine Plant for the North American market, and in Ford's then-new engine plant in Bridgend in Wales for the European market.
The engine was originally conceived in 1974. It is a cam-in-head engine with a single camshaft operating two valves per cylinder via rocker arms. Its valves were mounted at a compound angle in hemispherical combustion chambers, although some versions altered the combustion chamber shape to increase swirl. It also featured hydraulic valve lifters, a first for a European Ford engine. The engine was given different names throughout its production. From 1991 to 1996 in the Ford Escort, it was ""1.9L SEFI""; and from 1997 to 2002, it was ""Split Port Induction 2000"". From 2000 to 2004 in the Ford Focus, it was ""Split Port"".Despite its considerable shortcomings in terms of Noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) and its intolerance of poor or neglected servicing, the CVH was regarded as being a very easy engine to tune, with many of its key components being considerably over-engineered. It wasn't long before the engine started receiving attention from the aftermarket tuning industry, and the 1.6 L version quickly became a stalwart of the tuning scene in the 1980s and 1990s with some significant increases in power output (over 200 bhp (149 kW)) being extracted from the turbocharged variants. The naturally aspirated 1.6 L was a popular choice for the kit car industry, where it could be relatively easily and cheaply tweaked to around 130 bhp (97 kW).

However, by the beginning of the 16th century it had been rebuilt and refortified.  It was taken by James IV of Scotland on the eve of the Battle of Flodden in 1513. The castle passed from the Heron family to the Carr family by marriage in 1549 and again by marriage passed to Sir Francis Blake of Cogges, Oxfordshire in the 1660s.
Blake built a substantial mansion in Tudor style within the castle in 1694. On Blake's death in 1717 the Ford estate passed to the husband of his late daughter Mary and then in 1723 to her son Francis Blake Delaval (1692–1752). In 1761 John Delaval, 1st Baron Delaval (1728–1808) rebuilt the Hall with the assistance of architect George Raffield in a Gothic style.

On his death, the property passed to his granddaughter Susannah who had married the Marquess of Waterford. In 1862 Louisa, Dowager Marchioness of Waterford (d 1891), widow of the 3rd Marquess, restored and substantially remodelled the Hall.

All except the Cosworth 24v derivative and later 4.0 litre SOHC engines were pushrod overhead-valve engines, with a single camshaft between the banks.
Originally, the Cologne V6 was installed in vehicles intended for Germany and Continental Europe, while the unrelated British Essex V6 was used in cars for the British market. Later, the Cologne V6 largely replaced the Essex V6 for British-market vehicles. These engines were also used in the United States, especially in compact trucks.
The Cologne V6 was made to be very compatible in installation with the Ford Taunus V4 engine, having the same transmission bolt pattern, the same engine mounts, and in many versions, a cylinder head featuring ""siamesed"" exhaust passages, which reduced the three exhaust outlets down to two on each side. The latter feature was great for compatibility, but poor for performance. The 2.4, 2.8 (in U.S.), 2.9, and 4.0 had three exhaust ports, making them preferable.

He joined the Stella Polaris Gallery in 1983, where he met art critic and writer Edward Goldman, and host of KCRW's “Art Talk.” Goldman championed Crull's works, which were acquired by corporate art collections, and was also instrumental in Crull's first significant non-gallery show at the USC Fisher Museum of Art (then, the Fisher Gallery) at the University of Southern California.
In 1983 Crull relocated to New York City, and became a seminal figure in the East Village art scene. He was discovered by Colin de Land, founder of Vox Populi, and the Armory Art Show. Crull had several shows at the Vox Populi, a time marked also by commercial success, and national recognition for the artist. Crull's works were acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the National Gallery of Art, and the Dayton Art Institute.
In 1989, Crull was part of the very first showing of American artists in the USSR, Painting Beyond the Death of Painting at the Kuznetsky Most Exhibition Hall in Moscow curated by American art critic and historian, Donald Kuspit. This coincided with the time Crull was influenced by the Philosophy of Dualism. Upon his return from Russia, Crull began using steel framing for his paintings, with the edges burned. It was an invention that came to him after seeing the ancient icons in Russia. The new works were titled, “Relic Series”.
In a 1994 interview on the artist's work at Howard Scott Gallery in NYC noted art critic Eleanor Heartney stated,""The key to Crull’s vision is his simultaneous embrace of the uncertainties of the contemporary world and his affirmation of the reality of the individual consciousness within it. In his work, the authentic self remains the last bulwark against an anarchic world.""
From 2006 - 2010, Crull made several visits to Shanghai, China, culminating in the first of his subsequent interdisciplinary live art works. At the opening of the Bund 1919 art bank, a cultural and art enclave developed from five 1919 buildings at Shanghai No. 8 Cotton and Textile Factory, Crull executed a public art project to a live performance of pianist Shi Wen.",

881539.0,0,Ford D2C platform,"The Ford D2C platform (for ""D-class 2-door coupe"") is one of Ford's rear-wheel drive automobile platforms.
The platform basics are a MacPherson strut suspension in front and 3-link solid axle in the rear with a Panhard rod.  Unlike previous Special Vehicle Team (SVT) Mustang variations, the Shelby GT500 does not include independent rear suspension, but instead has a solid rear axle.
Considered a new platform by Ford Motor Company, D2C is loosely based on the Ford DEW platform which served as the basis for the Lincoln LS, Ford Thunderbird, and Jaguar S-Type. The 2005 S197 Mustang was originally designed to use a ""Lite"" version of the DEW98 platform, but while that plan was eventually scrapped as too expensive, most D2C platform development completed prior to that decision was retained. This led to the carryover of several DEW98 chassis components. These components include the floor pans, portions of the transmission tunnel, the front frame rails, and basic fuel tank design.Differences between D2C and DEW98 are most noticeable in the suspension:  The DEW98-based Lincoln LS uses a 4-wheel independent double wishbone suspension. The D2C platform's MacPherson strut front suspension and solid axle rear suspension are less expensive to produce than  DEW's more complicated setup. D2C also shares components with other Ford platforms. These include Ford's global C1 platform, with which D2C shares front strut and rear trailing arm components.
Ford's The Way Forward plan called for Mustang derivative models (such as a 4-door) to be launched by 2008, but that never occurred.A new generation was launched in Model Year 2015 with the new S550, adding an independent rear suspension (IRS).",

Marking the adoption of unibody chassis construction, a transverse engine configuration, front-wheel drive, all-wheel drive, and the lack of a V8 engine (for the first time since 1931), the D3 platform is derived from the 1998-2016 Volvo P2 architecture (designed prior to the 1999 acquisition of Volvo by Ford). Since 2008, the related D4 platform has served as a basis for crossover SUVs.
While the vehicles of the D3 platform were officially introduced as the replacement for the 1999-2007 D186 platform (Ford Taurus), in terms of market position and interior volume, they would effectively supersede the Ford and Mercury vehicles of the 1978-2012 Panther platform.

In 1965 the range covered rigid trucks with gross weights from 5.2 to 12.75 British tons, and tippers from 10.8 to 12.75 tons. Higher gross weights became available with the subsequent introduction of versions featuring twin rear axles and articulated models were also quickly added to the range.Three new diesel engines were developed for the trucks, respectively of 3.97 litres, 5.42 litres and 5.95 litres cylinder capacity. The smallest unit was of four cylinders while the larger engines employed six cylinders. Claimed power ranged from 82.5 bhp to 128 bhp. Possibly with an eye to export markets outside Europe, petrol-engined versions with power outputs of 129 bhp and 149 bhp were also offered.As on the Bedford TK and on various US built heavy trucks of the time, the cabin was a flat fronted forward control unit positioned above the engine. Engine access was achieved by tilting the entire cab forwards:  the hinge at the front employed a torsion-bar counterbalancing system which according to commentators made tilting the cab to access the engine ""almost a one-hand job"".   The engines were installed at an angle of 45 degrees from the vertical which was intended to enable the cab interior to feature a virtually flat floor without the cab itself becoming excessively tall.April 1967 saw the range expanded upwards with the arrival of the Phase II D1000 series, designed for operation up to a weight of 28 tons gross, and at that time the largest trucks ever produced by Ford of Britain. The D1000s were powered by Cummins produced V8 diesel engines of 7.7 litres displacement.In 1981 the range was replaced by the Ford Cargo in European markets and by the Ford N series (badge-engineered Hino Ranger) in Australasia.

He is also the winner of the 2013 Herzberg Medal of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and the 2017 Killam Prize.Doolittle has made significant contributions to the study of cyanobacteria. He found evidence for the endosymbiont origins of chloroplasts, and developed a theoretical basis for the initial evolution of eukaryotes. He has shown the importance of horizontal gene transfer in prokaryotic evolution.
As of 2007, he has been Professor Emeritus at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia.  He received his BA in Biochemical Sciences from Harvard University in 1963 and his PhD from Stanford University in 1967, under Charles Yanofsky. He went on to do postdoctoral fellowships with Sol Spiegelman and Norman R. Pace.
In 1981, Doolittle received some level of notoriety for his article in The CoEvolution Quarterly entitled ""Is Nature Really Motherly?"".  This was a sharp rebuttal of J. E. Lovelock's formulation of the Gaia Theory. Doolittle's article is often cited by Lovelock's critics.
Because of his philosophical musings on the non-existence of an all-encompassing Tree of Life, Doolittle has occasionally been cited on Intelligent Design blogs. However, though Doolittle argues that a bifurcating tree is not an adequate metaphor for the evolution of life on earth, he is not a supporter of Intelligent Design. A single common ancestor and tree relating all of life on earth is not a necessary component of the theory of descent with modification, the essence of evolution.
Doolittle is currently involved in a debate about the proper use of function (biology) within evolutionary biology sparked by controversy over the results of the ENCODE consortium stating that 80% of the genome is ""functional"". He is a supporter of the concept of junk DNA.
In addition to his contributions to evolutionary biology, Doolittle is an artist who studied at NSCAD University, achieving a BA in photography.",

Just over 100 Ecostars were produced, and used in fleet tests between 1992 and 1996 with over 1,000,000 miles (1,609,344 km) driven. The Ecostar averaged 94 miles (151 km) on a full charge, and demonstrated 155 miles (249 km) range in one test. However, on several occasions the battery burst into flame during use. For this, and several other reasons, Ford lost interest in the sodium-sulfur battery and turned to fuel cell concepts instead.
The product niche appeared to be a useful one and has led to a number of similar designs. While the 1998 Citroën Berlingo électrique was almost identical in performance and range, it just replaced the older 1991 C15 électrique. Ford is re-entering the market as well, with an electric version of the Transit Connect.

It was essentially the concurrent Mercury Cougar XR-7 with a mild front end restyling to resemble the Thunderbird, different taillamps with a center reflector, unique twin opera windows and large color-keyed vinyl moldings placed higher on the bodysides. The interiors were identical save for upholstery styles and minor trim. 
Introduced February 18th, 1974 as the Gran Torino Elite, it was initially the top of the line model of the Torino series. Although advertised separately, it was titled and registered as a Gran Torino.  For 1975 and 1976, the Gran Torino prefix was dropped and Elite became a stand-alone model nameplate. Early pre-production publicity photos for the 1974 model show the use of Gran Torino XL nameplates.The Elite name was dropped after 1976 because the Ford mid-size range was restructured for the 1977 model year. The Thunderbird was dramatically reduced in size and price for 1977 by moving the nameplate to the Torino-based LTD II platform which replaced the Torino. In effect, the Elite continued restyled and marketed under the more-recognized Thunderbird name, and the previous full-sized Thunderbird was discontinued.",

Sharing its name with the third-generation European Ford Escort, the model line is the first front-wheel drive Ford developed and sold in North America.  The direct successor of the Ford Pinto, as the smallest Ford car in North America, the Escort largely replaced the European-imported Ford Fiesta.
Overcoming the tarnished reputation for quality and safety established by the fuel tank defect of the Pinto, the Escort became highly successful in the American marketplace.  After 1982, the model line became the best-selling car in the United States, a position it held during most of the 1980s.
The 1981 replacement of the Pinto by the Escort was the first Ford model line to adapt front-wheel drive.  By the end of the 1980s, nearly the entire Ford car range would adopt the powertrain layout (with the exceptions being the Mustang, Thunderbird, and LTD Crown Victoria/Country Squire).
The Escort was produced across three generations.  The first was Ford's first ""world car"", designed as Ford of Europe transitioned the Escort Mk III to front-wheel drive.  In North America, the model line was also sold as the Mercury Lynx and the two-seat Ford EXP/Mercury LN7 (no version was sold by the Lincoln division).  Introduced for 1991, the second generation became a near-twin of the Mazda-designed Ford Laser (a model line sold in Asia and Oceania); sharing a platform and powertrain with the Mazda 323, the Escort grew into the compact car segment.  The second generation was also sold as the Mercury Tracer.  For 1997, the third generation was an extensive redesign of the second-generation platform Escort sedan, introducing the ZX2 coupe; Mercury continued to sell the Tracer sedan and wagon.

Along with exterior design changes to enhance aerodynamics, many changes were made to the interior, adding fold-flat front seats and larger touchscreens (including a fully digital instrument panel).
The powertrain line is largely carried over from the previous generation, with a 3.3-liter V6, 2.7-liter and 3.5-liter EcoBoost twin-turbo V6s, a 5.0-liter V8, and a 3.0-liter diesel V6. 
However, the 5.0-liter V8 receives a new cylinder deactivation system, called Variable Displacement Engine  technology, similar to GM's Active Fuel Management and Chrysler's Multi-Displacement System. The six-speed automatic is dropped, with all engines paired to a 10-speed automatic.Dubbed PowerBoost, an optional gasoline-electric hybrid powertrain was introduced for the first time in a Ford light truck, pairing an electric motor with the 3.5-liter V6.",

Lower and wider than the previous generation, the fourth-generation F-Series marked several design changes to the F-Series, distinguished by bed sides matching the hood line and window sill in height.  The model line returned to two headlights, a change that remained in place for over 50 years.  
Originally intended as the successor for the Styleside, Ford developed an all-new configuration, developing a body constructed in line with the car-based Ford Ranchero.  Dubbed the ""integrated pickup"", Ford welded the cab and body together before their placement on the frame (removing the cab-bed gap).  By 1964, Ford reverted entirely to the traditional separate cab and bed design for the Styleside bed.For 1965, the fourth generation underwent a substantial revision, with Ford introducing a chassis and cab that would underpin the F-Series through 1979.  The update marked the introduction of the long-running ""Twin I-Beam"" independent front suspension and 300 cubic-inch inline-6.  Taken from the defunct Edsel brand, the Ford Ranger name made its first appearance.    
The model line was assembled by Ford across multiple facilities across the United States, Canada, and Mexico; the model line was also assembled by Ford Argentina.  In Canada, the F-Series was again sold as the Mercury M-Series.",

Derived from the smaller F-Series pickup trucks, the medium-duty range is currently in its eighth generation.  Initially slotted between the F-Series pickup trucks and the ""Big Job"" conventionals, later generations were slotted below the L-Series ""Louisville"" trucks; the last two generations are the largest vehicles produced by Ford since its exit from the heavy-truck segment.
Throughout its production, the medium-duty F-Series has been used for an extensive number of applications, offered as a straight (rigid) truck and a truck-tractor (for semitrailers) in multiple cab configurations.  Prior to the production of the Ford C-Series, the model line was also offered in a cab-over engine (COE) configuration; a cowled-chassis variant (the Ford B-series) was used for bus production.  At various stages, the model line has competed against medium-duty versions of the Chevrolet/GMC C/K (later the Kodiak/TopKick), the International S-series, and the Freightliner Business Class (FL-Series and M2).
Since 1999, the medium-duty F-Series has been included within the Ford Super Duty range, consisting of the Class 6-7 Ford F-650 and F-750; Class 8 versions of the F-750 have been produced since 2011.  The current generation of the F-650 and F-750 are manufactured by Ford in its Ohio Assembly facility (Avon Lake, Ohio), replacing a joint venture with Navistar International named Blue Diamond Truck Company LLC located in General Escobedo, Mexico.",

To improve the aerodynamics of the exterior, the front fascia underwent a substantial revision to its design.  The FlareSide bed design made its return, following a substantial change in its design.       
In 1996, the tenth-generation F-Series was released (including the F-150) for the 1997 model year.  The ninth-generation F-250 and F-350 remained in production through the 1997 and 1998 model years, respectively.

In place of the previous ""Bonus-Built"" series, Ford now marketed its truck range as the ""Triple Economy"" series.To further emphasize the model update, Ford changed the F-Series model nomenclature from a single number to three numbers; subsequently, this system has remained in use on all Ford F-Series trucks to the present day.   
Alongside the naming change, this generation marked several firsts for the F-Series, including an adjustable seat (wide enough for 3 people), power brakes, and the introduction of the Ford-O-Matic automatic transmission as an option.  In line with Ford cars, seat belts were introduced as an option for 1956.The second-generation F-Series was produced by Ford at eleven facilities across the United States; Ford Canada marketed the model line under both the F-Series and the Mercury M-Series nameplates.  Ford of Brazil inaugurated local production with the model line, producing it from 1957 to 1962.",

The first complete redesign of the F-Series since the 1965 model year, the seventh generation received a completely new chassis and body, distinguished by flatter body panels and a squarer grille.  This generation marked several firsts for the model line, including the introduction of the Ford Blue Oval grille emblem, the introduction of a diesel engine to the model line, and a dashboard with a full set of instruments (optional).  Conversely, this generation marked the end of the long-running F-100, the Ranger trim, and sealed-beam headlamps.  This was also be the final generation of the F-Series produced with the traditional Flareside bed, using separate rear fenders and taillamps, steel sides, and an (optional) wooden floor.  
Serving as the basis for the eighth and ninth-generation F-Series, the 1980 F-Series architecture lasted through the 1998 model year, also underpinning the Ford Bronco from 1980 to 1996.  Though sharing almost no body parts, the model line again shared mechanical commonality with the Ford E-Series.

Produced by Ford in North America, Argentina, and Australia, this is the third and final generation of trucks derived from the 1965 Ford F-Series.
The sixth generation marked several functional design changes and an expansion of the model line.  For 1973, the regular cab F-350 became available with a wide ""Styleside"" bed for the first time.  For 1974, a ""SuperCab"" extended cab pickup truck was introduced, between the two-door standard cab and the four-door crew cab.  For 1975, the F-150 was introduced; a higher-payload version of the F-100 (intended to circumvent emissions standards), the F-150 would become the most popular version of the model line (ultimately replacing the F-100).  A second generation of the Ford Bronco SUV was released for 1978 (after several years of delays) on a shortened F-100 chassis.   
In 1977, the model line became the best-selling truck in the United States, a position it has held ever since.

The first ground-up redesign of the F-Series since 1980, the tenth generation saw the introduction of an all-new chassis and a completely new body.  In a significant model change, the tenth generation was developed only for the F-150 (and later a light-duty F-250), with the ninth-generation F-250 and F-350 replaced by the all-new Ford Super Duty variant of the F-Series for 1999.   
Alongside its all-new body and chassis, the tenth-generation F-150 saw further changes to the F-Series line, including the retirement of the Twin I-Beam front suspension (the first Ford light truck to do so), an entirely new engine lineup, and the addition of a rear door (later two) to SuperCab trucks.  The F-150 again served as the basis for Ford full-size SUVs, as the long-running Ford Bronco was replaced by the five-door Ford Expedition for 1997, with Lincoln-Mercury introducing the Lincoln Navigator for 1998.  For 2002, Lincoln-Mercury marketed its own version of the F-Series, introducing the Lincoln Blackwood as the first Lincoln pickup truck.     
Through its production, the model line was assembled by multiple Ford facilities in the United States, Canada, and Mexico; after its replacement in 2004, this generation was rebranded as the Ford Lobo in Mexico from 2004 to 2010 (when it was replaced by the twelfth-generation F-150).",

Following its competitors at Dodge and General Motors, Ford widened the front bodywork to integrate the cab and front fenders together.  Going a step further, the F-Series integrated the hood into the bodywork with a clamshell design; the feature would stay part of the F-Series for two decades.  Although offered previously, the optional chrome grille was far more prominent than before.  In the rear, two types of pickup boxes were offered, starting a new naming convention: the traditional separate-fender box was dubbed ""Flareside"", while ""Styleside"" boxes integrated the pickup bed, cab, and front fenders together. As before, Ford still offered a low-GVWR version of each model.
In May 1957, Ford discontinued building trucks at the Highland Park Ford Plant in Highland Park, Michigan. All light and medium trucks were transferred to 10 other plants in the USA. After 1969, Heavy-duty trucks (above F-350) and some light duty trucks were transferred to Kentucky Truck Assembly in Louisville, Kentucky. Third generation trucks were built in Brazil as the F-100, F-350, and F-600 from 1962 until 1971.
OHV sixes and V8s were the same ones as used in Ford cars of the era.
This was the last generation of the panel van.  Ford would not offer a full-size van again until the 1968 introduction of the second generation E-Series.

The final generation of the F-150 produced with a separate body design from the Super Duty trucks (F-250 to F-550), the twelfth generation again adopted an all-new chassis and body, also marking an extensive transition to the powertrain lineup.   
Alongside the all-new model design, the new generation started a model shift for the F-150.  In all but the most fleet-oriented trim levels, Ford introduced higher-quality interior materials and features.  In the United States, the Lincoln Mark LT was repackaged as the highest-content Ford F-150 Platinum trim (a Mark LT based on the twelfth generation was designed, exclusive to Mexico).  For 2010, the SVT Raptor was introduced as the highest-performance F-Series truck; in contrast to the previous Ford SVT Lightning trucks, the Raptor was optimized for off-road performance.   
In North America, the twelfth-generation F-150 was assembled by Ford at its Dearborn Truck facility (Dearborn, Michigan) and its Kansas City Assembly facility (Claycomo, Missouri).  In December 2014, production of the model line ended, with Ford introducing the thirteenth-generation F-series.",

9211058.0,0,Ford FT-B,"The Ford FT B (also known as Ford Tf-c and model 1920) was the first armoured car designed and built in Poland. Built on the chassis of the Ford T and armoured with re-used armoured plates, the car was a successful design for its time. The main designer was the engineer Tadeusz Tański. The armoured vehicle originated on account of the high demand during the Polish-Soviet war in 1920.
After the outbreak of the Polish-Soviet War in 1919, the Polish Army was severely under-equipped. Except for a number of Renault FT tanks that arrived with the Blue Army formed in France, the Polish forces lacked any armoured reconnaissance vehicles. During the Soviet offensive leading to the battle of Warsaw the situation became even more tragic as many Austin-Putilov Armoured Cars captured from the Red Army were retaken by the Bolsheviks. It was then that engineer Tadeusz Tański, a renowned inventor and a worker of the Ministry of Military Affairs, designed his armoured car. The project originated within only 2 weeks from Tanski’s initiative. The prototype was prepared in less than two weeks in the Gerlach i Pulsing works in Warsaw. After a series of tests the production started, and each of the battle-ready cars was immediately dispatched to the front-line and attached to various units. Altogether a series of 16 or 17 cars were made.
The project was based on the successful Ford Model T, one of the most popular cars of the epoch. The chassis and the levers were significantly reinforced and the fuel tank was moved. In addition, the crank was extended to allow for starting the engine from the inside and the dashboard had been modified. The armoured plating was handmade out of scrapped German armoured trench shields, and attached to the chassis by bolts.

The FT-B cars took part in the later stage of the Polish-Soviet war and fought in the battles along the Wkra river and in the battle of Warsaw, as well as the battle of Kowel and in numerous other battles.
The high speed, agility, and uncomplicated servicing and repair (thanks to the  commercial Ford T chassis) were among the advantages of the vehicle. In spite of the extra weight of the armour, the vehicles managed well in heavy terrain, and were also able to cross relatively weak bridges on account of their low mass in comparison to other armoured vehicles. The Ford Tf C was really small in comparison to other armoured vehicles of the era, being for example half the size of the Austin-Putilov, and offered a smaller target. Nevertheless, the consequence was that Ford Tf C were very cramped inside, and the driver had to steer from a squatting position. Another problem was engine overheating during longer cross-countrydrives, or with let down cooler armour plating. Also, the springs were overloaded in spite of strengthening, but the vehicle was urgently required and the advantages offset the defects. In 1921 Tanski offered to build another series of 30 vehicles; however, this was rejected, because the war was over and no other armoured vehicles were required. 12 Fords Tf C armored vehicles outlasted the war and were in use until 1931. Some had proper names such as ""Osa"" (wasp), ""Mucha"" (fly), and ""Komar"" (mosquito) painted on their armor.",

Through its production, the model line would be marketed in a wide variety of body styles, including two-door and four-door sedans, two-door and four-door hardtops, station wagons, and both traditional and retractable-hardtop convertibles.  
Initially introduced as the flagship of the full-size Ford range, the Fairlane marked the introduction of the Crown Victoria and 500 nameplates, both later becoming stand-alone full-size model lines (the latter, as the Ford Five Hundred).
Following the introduction of the Ford Galaxie, the Fairlane was repackaged as an intermediate-segment car (today, mid-size) from 1962 to 1970.  For 1971, Ford expanded the Ford Torino nameplate across its entire intermediate range, dropping the Fairlane (and Falcon) nameplates in North America.

This was Ford Australia's top-of-the-range model until replaced by an Australian-assembled version of the full-sized American Ford Galaxie. In 1967, Ford Australia reintroduced the Fairlane, this time as an Australian-developed, luxury, long-wheelbase version of its mainstream Falcon/Fairmont, positioned between the Falcon and the Galaxie. The locally assembled Galaxie evolved into the LTD which was itself replaced in 1973 by an Australian-developed, Fairlane-based model, also known as the Ford LTD. In North America, unlike its designation in Australia, it was not considered a luxury vehicle. In Australia, ""LTD"" originally stood for ""Lincoln Type Design"", although Ford Australia later promoted a connection with the meaning ""Limited"".The Fairlane and LTD competed in the marketplace with the Holden Brougham (1968–1971), the Statesman (1971–1984), and later with the Holden Statesman and Caprice (1990–2007).

Previously the Falcon range also included a hardtop coupé, panel van and station wagon (respectively up to 1978, 1999 and 2010)., as well as the Futura variant. The Falcon platform had also spawned luxury models such as the Landau coupe and long-wheelbase Fairlane and LTD sedans.
In May 2013, Ford Australia announced the end of local production, which consisted of Falcon and its closely related Territory crossover SUV, by October 2016. This decision was attributable to Ford Motor Company's ""One Ford"" product development plan introduced in 2008 to rationalise its global range. Under this plan, Falcon's indirect replacements are the fourth-generation Mondeo from Europe and the sixth-generation Mustang from North America, the latter to retain Ford's Australian V8 heritage. The final Ford Falcon, a blue XR6, rolled off the production line on 7 October 2016.",

Interiors, too, were substantially revised, while mechanically, a new independent rear suspension setup was fitted to all sedan derivatives and the engine and transmissions received extensive upgrades. In October 2004, Ford introduced a Mark II update, bringing subtle styling and mechanical changes, and in October 2005, replaced the BA with the BF.

During its production, the Falcon served as the basis for multiple Ford vehicle lines, including the first generations of the Ford Mustang pony car and the Ford Econoline/Ford Club Wagon vans.
Through the 1960s, Ford produced three generations of the Falcon, all derived on the same platform architecture.  For the 1970 model year, the Falcon was replaced by the Ford Maverick, through the 1975 introduction of the Ford Granada, the chassis of the 1960 Ford Falcon was used through the 1980 model year in North America, and until 1991 in Argentina.

The Focus RS WRC was in competition from 1999 to 2010, winning 44 world rallies and two manufacturers' world titles (2006 and 2007). It was replaced by the Ford Fiesta RS WRC.
Like all contemporary World Rally Cars, the car is heavily modified from the production version, with which it shares only the basic shape and some parts of the bodyshell. The car features four-wheel drive, rather than the front-wheel drive of the road car. The engine used in the 2007 Focus WRC is based on Ford's 2.0 Litre Duratec from other models in the Focus range as rallying rules do not permit the standard 2.5-litre engine of the Focus ST or road going RS. As with most rally cars, the 2.0-litre engine is heavily modified and performance was increased using a turbocharger. The 2009 Ford Focus RS WRC uses a Ford 1998cc Pipo built l4 Duratec WRC engine (four cylinders, 16 valves, bore 85 mm and stroke 88 mm), Pi electronic engine management system, Garrett turbocharger (with required 34 mm inlet restrictor), air intercooler, and a catalytic converter.
The car's transmission is a permanent four-wheel drive with an M-Sport designed active centre differential, Pi electronic differential control units, M-Sport/Ricardo five-speed sequential gearbox with electro-hydraulically controlled shift and an M-Sport/Sachs multi-disc carbon clutch.",

William Hutchinson, a contemporary author writing about Sir John Hussey Delaval's Ford estate which included Ford Forge, commented as follows.

About a mile down the river, a Plating Forge was erected in 1769, where a large quantity of shovels, spades and other plate-iron works are made, as well for home consumption, as for exportation at the ports of Berwick, Newcastle, etc. The scheme, when carried to its intended extent, will be of great consequence to this part of the country.

Between 1955 and 1974, the foundation sold its Ford Motor Company holdings and now plays no role in the automobile company.
Ahead of the foundation selling its Ford Motor Company holdings, in 1949, Henry Ford II created the Ford Motor Company Fund, a separate corporate foundation that to this day serves as the philanthropic arm of the Ford Motor Company and is not associated with the foundation.
The Ford Foundation makes grants through its headquarters and ten international field offices. For many years, the foundation's financial endowment was the largest private endowment in the world; it remains among the wealthiest. For fiscal year 2014, it reported assets of US$12.4 billion and approved US$507.9 million in grants.

Designed by architect Kevin Roche and engineering partner John Dinkeloo in the late modernist style, the building was one of the first that Roche-Dinkeloo produced after they became heads of Eero Saarinen's firm.
The building consists of a glass-and-steel cube held up by piers made of concrete and clad with Dakota granite. The main entrance is set along 43rd Street. A second entrance on 42nd Street leads to a large public atrium, the first such atrium in an office building in Manhattan. The atrium contains landscaping from Dan Kiley and includes plants, shrubs, trees, and vines. Most offices in the building are north and west of the atrium and are visible from other offices in the building.
The building was commissioned for the Ford Foundation, then the largest private foundation in the United States, after Henry Heald became foundation president. The Ford Foundation Building was announced in 1963 and completed in 1968 on the former site of the Hospital for the Ruptured and Crippled. Between 2015 and 2018, the Ford Foundation Building underwent a major renovation and restoration project, and it was renamed the Ford Foundation Center for Social Justice. The Ford Foundation Building has been critically acclaimed for its design, both after its completion and after the renovation. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the building and its atrium as city landmarks in 1997.

Introduced for compact sedans in the 1978 model year, the Fox architecture was utilized for a wide variety of configurations for Ford and Lincoln-Mercury vehicles. In its original form, the platform was used through the 1993 model year; a substantial redesign of the Ford Mustang extended its life into the 21st century, ending production in 2004.  Produced across 26 model years, the Fox platform is the second-longest car architecture ever designed by Ford Motor Company (behind the Panther platform, 33 model years).
Designed to be relatively lightweight and simple, the Fox platform was initially developed to replace several derivatives of the Ford Falcon compact architecture dating from 1960. For 1978, the Ford Fairmont and Mercury Zephyr were the first models derived from the chassis, replacing the Ford Maverick and Mercury Comet. As downsizing expanded into the intermediate segment, the Fox platform came into use for mid-size applications, replacing the larger Ford Torino chassis. While best known for underpinning the Ford Mustang pony car, the Fox platform also saw use in personal luxury segments, underpinning coupes for all three Ford divisions.
During the mid-1980s, the usage of the Fox platform began to decline as Ford transitioned its compact and mid-size vehicle lines to front-wheel drive. After the 1992 model year, the Ford Mustang was the sole model to use the chassis. For 2005, the fifth-generation Ford Mustang adopted the rear-wheel drive D2C platform, the fifth and final vehicle architecture developed as a Fox-platform replacement.",

Ford succeeded with the GT40, winning the 1966 through 1969 races.
The effort began in the early 1960s when Ford Advanced Vehicles began to build the GT40 Mk I, based upon the Lola Mk6, at their base in Slough, UK. After disappointing race results, the engineering team was moved in 1964 to Dearborn, Michigan (Kar Kraft). The range was powered by a series of American-built Ford V8 engines modified for racing.  
In 1966, the GT40 Mk II broke Ferrari's streak at Le Mans, notching the first win for an American manufacturer in a major European race since Jimmy Murphy's triumph with Duesenberg at the 1921 French Grand Prix. In 1967, the Mk IV became the only car designed and built entirely in the United States to achieve the overall win at Le Mans.

In 1985, Ford Gum was acquired by Leaf. Leaf's American operations were acquired by Hershey in 1996, and Ford Gum was subject to a management buyout the next year.
Today, Ford Gum and Machine Co. is headquartered in Akron, NY and has a sales office in Buffalo Grove, IL. The company is the only large scale manufacturer of gumballs in the US.

The Ford Laser was a restyled version of the Familia/323 models produced by Mazda in Japan from 1980 onwards. Ford had acquired a 25% stake in Mazda in 1979.
Platform and assembly-line sharing with the locally produced Mazda Familia in Japan allowed the Laser in that market to be offered with a plethora of engine, paint and trim configurations not available anywhere else in the world. This was most notably evident during the 1980s with multiple turbocharged variants, unique bodyshells such as the cabriolet, and full-time 4WD models all available years before their debuts in other markets (and in some cases, never making it offshore at all). Along with the Japanese produced Ford Telstar and Ford Festiva, the Laser was sold at special Autorama dealerships.In Australia and New Zealand, where Ford was seen as a local brand, the locally assembled Laser outsold its Mazda twin, the 323, especially in Australia, where the 323 was imported. According to research carried out by Ford Australia in 1984, a third of Laser buyers were unaware that the Ford model was based on the Mazda 323.However, in neighbouring Asian markets, such as Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong, as well as Japan itself, the reverse was the case, although pooling resources with Mazda allowed Ford to maintain a foothold in the region.

The Mach I was a single-seat automobile which rode on pressurized air, not wheels. Its name was inspired by the speed Mach 1, an aspiration speed not yet achieved by vehicles at the time. It used air pressure at a force of 15–100 psi (100–690 kPa) to provide lift and propulsion. In experiments, 50–60 psi (340–410 kPa) was used so that 15 hp (11 kW) was needed for levitation and 2.5 hp (1.9 kW) propelled it 20 mph (32 km/h). An advertisement for the Mach I appeared in the magazine Boys' Life in 1960, in which it indicated the single-seater's dimensions: 94 in (2.4 m) long; 48 in (1.2 m) high; 54 in (1.4 m) wide.The Levacar project was led by Andrew A. Kucher (a Ford Vice-President for Engineering and Research) and David J. Jay (a Senior Development Engineer). Kucher had initially conceived the concept around 1930. One of the lead designers was Gale Halderman, known for the initial designer of the Ford Mustang.  In addition to the Mach I automobile, the project also developed a similarly outfitted scooter, the Levascooter.

1338974.0,0,Ford MEL engine,"Ford developed the MEL (""Mercury-Edsel-Lincoln"") engine series as the replacement for the Lincoln Y-block V8 engine for use in large passenger car applications. These engines were produced in Lima, Ohio at Ford's Lima Engine plant. They were in turn replaced by the 385 series engines.
All MEL engines had wedge-shaped combustion chambers formed between a flat head surface and an angle milled block deck (10 degrees off square with the bore axis), with the piston top determining the compression ratio and combustion chamber shape, similar to the Chevrolet Big-Block 348 combustion chamber, also introduced in 1958, and the later 409 and 427. Unlike the Chevrolet, which had staggered valves and scalloped or M shaped valve covers, the MEL valves were inline with shaft mounted rocker arms like the FE model Ford engines which were introduced at the same time. As with the previous generation V8s, an open runner intake manifold was used, requiring the use of a stamped steel lifter valley cover similar to that of the Pontiac V8 engines. Also, the intake manifold provided no exhaust crossover passage to warm the air-fuel mixture. Further MEL engines employed two individual thermostats, aimed to improve the regulation of the engine's coolant temperature.
The MEL bore some mechanical similarities with the Ford FE, utilizing similar components such as the oiling system, bolt patterns, and valve stems; however, the MEL was a Lincoln-specific engine and was even larger in displacement capacity. The main bearings were 73.66 mm (2.900 in), while the rod bearings were 66.04 mm (2.600 in). The connecting rod beam had a unique triangular shape with the shoulders for the bolts sitting low toward the cap mating surface 1⁄2 in (13 mm). There was one major difference between the MEL and FE engines besides their size and weight; the valves on MEL engines were arranged in alternating fashion (I-E-I-E-I-E-I-E) and not in the manner of the FE (E-I-E-I-I-E-I-E) where the I indicates an intake valve and the E indicates an exhaust valve.
The MEL was one of three new engine families introduced by Lincoln and Ford in 1958. The others were the FE (Ford Edsel) and SD (super duty), the latter being large and extra powerful, slow-revving engines engineered for heavy-duty work trucks. The FE engine saw its use in the Edsel, a model which was introduced to the vehicle lineup by Ford, described as a car which blended design features of the Ford and Mercury lines combining them with its own individual styling.

1269094.0,0,Ford MTX-75 transmission,"The Ford MTX-75 (Manual TransaXle), is a 5-speed transmission developed by Ford Motor Company for its larger-engined front wheel drive models. ""75"" refers to the distance in millimeters between the main and lay shafts.
Debuting in 1992, the transmission was developed in tandem with the Zetec family of engines. The transmission is optimised for transferring larger levels of torque than the older iB-series unit used on the Fiesta and Escort models. Other features include the provision of equal length driveshafts (to combat torque steer) and synchromesh on reverse gear.
The transmission was first used on the Zetec-engined Escort Mk V (only XR3i), but its proper intended application was on the Mondeo and its derivatives (the American Ford Contour, Mercury Mystique and the New Edge Mercury/Ford Cougar). 2000-2004 Focus with Zetec engine with manual used this transmission, as well as all diesel powered versions of the Focus.
The main change to the unit was to cable operation in 1996 on the facelifted Mondeo, as the rod-based linkage of the original unit attracted criticism for feeling vague and notchy.

Despite popular belief that the Modular engine family received its moniker from the sharing of engine parts across numerous Ford vehicle platforms, in reality, the Modular engine family was named as such by Ford Motor Company for the new “modular approach” to the setup of tooling and casting stations in the Windsor and Romeo engine manufacturing plants.
This new “modular approach” allowed for significantly faster changeovers when switching from one engine platform to another among the Modular engine family. This also allowed for the existing engine plants, and their supporting offsite production facilities, to handle shorter production runs. Implementing shorter production runs without incurring large shutdown and retooling expenses helped to increase the versatility of those production stations that required tooling or machining setups specific to a certain vehicle platform.
The Modular engine family started with the 4.6L in 1990 for the 1991 model year. The Modular engines are used in various Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles. Modular engines used in Ford trucks were marketed under the Triton name from 1997–2010 while the InTech name was used for a time at Lincoln and Mercury for vehicles equipped with DOHC versions of the engines.

43301571.0,0,Ford Mondeo (second generation),"The Ford Mondeo Mk3 (second generation) model was launched by Ford in October 2000. This Mondeo was considerably larger than its predecessor, and although Ford abandoned its New Edge design theme for the second generation, it was their first vehicle to fully benefit from the Prodigy concept car. This gave it an overall effect which many critics felt was more restrained and mature, if much less distinctive. Two of the old car's biggest weaknesses, the modest rear legroom, and uncompetitive diesel version were addressed by a 50 mm (2.0 in) longer wheelbase and the new Duratorq diesel engine. The basic chassis and suspension design was carried over from the previous generation, which meant that the car continued its predecessor's reputation for class leading handling and ride. This Mondeo came to Mexico, replacing the North American built Ford Contour, and was sold from 2001 to 2007, when the Ford Fusion replaced it. The North American market Fusion and Ford Five Hundred/Taurus sported very similar styling, inside and out.
Following the standard setting interior of the Volkswagen Passat (B5) in 1996, Ford paid a great deal of attention to the second generation Mondeo's interior and was the first major American manufacturer to react to the new standard set by Volkswagen. Ford dispensed with the rounded American style interior of the first generation, and developed a more sober 'Germanic' design, which not only seemed more sophisticated but, more importantly, was of a higher quality due to the use of more expensive materials.
This Mondeo simplified trim levels a lot, for example the UK trims had been simplified down to
LX, Zetec, Zetec S, Ghia, Ghia X and ST. Despite this, a mid-cycle facelift in 2003 saw the introduction of some new trim levels. Titanium and Titanium X slotted in between Zetec S and Ghia, and ST220 slotted in above ST.
As with its predecessor, passive safety was a major selling point of the 2000 Mondeo. With an even stronger bodyshell, Ford introduced its so-called ""Intelligent Protection System"" (IPS), which used an ""intelligent"" array of sensors based on a neural network, to decide the best combination of safety devices (traditional front passenger airbags, side airbags and curtain airbags) to deploy for a given crash situation. To enhance active safety, all models were fitted with anti-lock brakes and electronic brake-force distribution, with electronic stability program (ESP) available as an option. Performance blue was also an option at £2000. Ford's marketing of the time claimed the Mondeo was 'One of the safest places to be'. However, Euro NCAP's testing of the 2000 to 2007 Mondeo found that it protected worse than most key rivals (Vauxhall Vectra, Citroën C5, Toyota Avensis, Volkswagen Passat), achieving a lower-end 4 star rating. Ford redesigned part of the car and it was re-tested, but the higher-than-average risk of chest injury to the driver in the frontal impact remained because the first and second generation Mondeo were based on the relatively dated CDW27 platform which related to the Mazda GE platform designed in late 1980s.
The Mondeo established itself as Britain's most popular automobile in its class and held this position every year from 2001 onwards, though this size of car has fallen slightly in popularity during the 2000s. This version of the Mondeo has never come higher than sixth in the SMMT's official list of the top selling cars in the UK each year. In 2003, it came tenth in the list.
The second generation Mondeo was never sold in Australia, as Ford Australia argued that the segment of the market was in decline. However in neighbouring New Zealand, it was voted Car of the Year in 2002 by the New Zealand Motoring Writers' Guild.",

Ford also owns Brazilian SUV manufacturer Troller, an 8% stake in Aston Martin of the United Kingdom and a 32% stake in Jiangling Motors. It also has joint-ventures in China (Changan Ford), Taiwan (Ford Lio Ho), Thailand (AutoAlliance Thailand), Turkey (Ford Otosan), and Russia (Ford Sollers). The company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is controlled by the Ford family; they have minority ownership but the majority of the voting power.Ford introduced methods for large-scale manufacturing of cars and large-scale management of an industrial workforce using elaborately engineered manufacturing sequences typified by moving assembly lines; by 1914, these methods were known around the world as Fordism. Ford's former UK subsidiaries Jaguar and Land Rover, acquired in 1989 and 2000 respectively, were sold to the Indian automaker Tata Motors in March 2008. Ford owned the Swedish automaker Volvo from 1999 to 2010. In 2011, Ford discontinued the Mercury brand, under which it had marketed entry-level luxury cars in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the Middle East since 1938.

During the financial crisis at the beginning of the 21st century, it struggled financially to the point of collapse which was in large part prevented by President George W. Bush announcing his emergency financial rescue plan to help Ford Motors as well as Chrysler LLC and General Motors, making immediately available $13.4 billion to the automaker. Ford Motors has since returned to profitability. Ford was the eleventh-ranked overall American-based company in the 2018 Fortune 500 list, based on global revenues in 2017 of $156.7 billion.

13106633.0,0,Ford Motor Company Lamp Factory,"The Ford Motor Co. Lamp Factory in Flat Rock, Michigan, was the product of a unique collaboration between industrialist Henry Ford and his lead designer, Albert Kahn. Albert Kahn Associates is a large Detroit firm that did extensive early and groundbreaking architectural design work for the Ford Motor Company.
Ford systematically acquired land, an existing dam on the Huron River, and water rights in the area where the old Metler and Diekman Mills stood. These rights along with over 200 acres (81 ha) from the George Case farm north and west of the mill race helped to comprise the eventual 568 acres (230 ha) that Ford eventually would own. Construction of a factory and a 385-foot (117 m) dam were carried out during 1921 and 1922. The dam had a fourfold purpose: to serve as a power plant, retain water in connection with the newly built water filtration plant, and to serve as a railroad bridge and a road for the passage of cars. Together the factory, dam/bridge, and water filtration plant represent a comprehensive program for the improvement of Flat Rock.
The factory, built by Stone & Webster, Inc., was one of several similar-appearing factories built for Ford, including others in Saint Paul, Minnesota, Green Island, New York, and Iron Mountain, Michigan.
Large turbines were once situated within the factory building. The eastern end of the plant was suspended from the land over water running through the mill race below. A photo from the 1930s shows this equipment setting in situ. Water power first generated was about 700 kilowatts.
Construction of the Ford complex had a profound and immediate impact on the residents of the area. The Village of Flat Rock was chartered on October 19, 1923. The following month the first headlamp was produced at the plant. So village and industry grew side-by-side.
Products the factory made included headlights, taillights, and interior light shells, reflectors, and lamp sockets. Five hundred men working two shifts at the plant could produce half a million headlights a month. During World War II, all of the 26 or so village industries were converted to participate in the war effort. The Flat Rock plant which produced head- and taillights, continued to produce these during the war, but for army trucks, Jeeps, tanks, the universal carrier, and the armored car. The Flat Rock plant also manufactured junction boxes for the B-24 bomber.
Benefits of having the Ford factory in the village of Flat Rock were numerous. First, there were the jobs created. Employment rose from 50 workers in 1924 to 500 by 925 and a peak of 1,200 people in 1929. In wages alone, over a half-million dollars in wages were paid in the peak years of 1929 and 1930. Approximately a third of the tax revenue for the village of Flat Rock was also generated by the plant.
Another benefit came from the water filtration plant. This produced water for the factory, but also for the communities of Flat Rock, Rockwood, and South Rockwood. The original filtration plant built in the 1920s was sold to the then City of Flat Rock in 1951 and continued to operate until 1957 when a new plant was built on the island, directly opposite and to the south of the Ford plant. This filtration plant too was eventually abandoned, though has not been demolished due to prohibitive costs associated with demolition.
Commentators attribute the demise of the village industries concept, which the Flat Rock plant was part of, to a variety of factors including company leadership not understanding the value or money-making potential of these enterprises, obsolescence of facilities, and most prominently – unionization (Siegel).
Production at the Flat Rock Head & Tail Light Plant ceased in 1950, and operations were moved to the larger Monroe factory. In 1950 the vacant Flat Rock plant was sold to Moynahan Bronze Company that was then located in Detroit and which subsequently moved. This company produced furniture for Pullman cars, architectural molding, and parts for aircraft. The firm would occupy the plant from 1951 to 1972. Stearns Manufacturing owned and operated the plant from 1972 to 1981, at which time the present owner, Flat Rock Metal Inc., leased the building. The company has since purchased it and has occupied the building to the present time (2018).",

In continuous production since 1964, the Mustang is currently the longest-produced Ford car nameplate. Currently in its sixth generation, it is the fifth-best selling Ford car nameplate. The namesake of the ""pony car"" automobile segment, the Mustang was developed as a highly styled line of sporty coupes and convertibles derived from existing model lines, initially distinguished by ""long hood, short deck"" proportions.Originally predicted to sell 100,000 vehicles yearly, the 1965 Mustang became the most successful vehicle launch since the 1927 Model A. Introduced on April 17, 1964 (16 days after the Plymouth Barracuda), over 400,000 units in its first year; the one-millionth Mustang was sold within two years of its launch. In August 2018, Ford produced the 10-millionth Mustang; matching the first 1965 Mustang, the vehicle was a 2019 Wimbledon White convertible with a V8 engine.The success of the Mustang launch led to multiple competitors from other American manufacturers, including the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird (1967), AMC Javelin (1968), and Dodge Challenger (1970). The Mustang also had an effect on designs of coupés worldwide, leading to the marketing of the Toyota Celica and Ford Capri in the United States (the latter, by Lincoln-Mercury). The Mercury Cougar was launched in 1967 as a unique-bodied higher-trim alternative to the Mustang; during the 1970s, it was repackaged as a personal luxury car.
From 1965 to 2004, the Mustang shared chassis commonality with other Ford model lines, staying rear-wheel-drive throughout its production.

During its operation, the FNR was used to study medicine, cellular biology, chemistry, physics, mineralogy, archeology, anthropology, and nuclear science.
The reactor was a swimming pool reactor, originally operating at 1 MW using 93% enriched U-235 aluminum-based fuel. It was later upgraded to 2 MW, using 19.5% enriched fuel. The Department of Energy fabricated, transported, and disposed of the fuel at no cost to the University. The reactor had a peak thermal flux of 3×1013 n/cm2s. It had 10 beam ports. It was constructed by Babcock & Wilcox under a subcontract with Leeds & Northrup.

The P69 sported large, free-standing aerofoil wings, which were vital to the car's stability at high-speeds.

At launch, the 17M was available with four different engine sizes, ranging from 1.5  to 2.3 litres. The more lavishly appointed 20M was also offered, but only with the larger two engines. The range was subsequently broadened further, and from 1969, the 26M joined the range, featuring the same body, but a larger engine, automatic transmission as standard, and various other luxury features.The Taunus 17M name had been applied to a succession of family saloons/sedans from Ford Germany since 1957, but the introduction of the 1967 car coincided with the removal of the “Taunus” name. Nevertheless, for the avoidance of confusion, the 17M and 20M models introduced in 1967, as well as the 26M introduced in 1969, are usually identified, in retrospect, as the Ford P7. It was the seventh newly designed German Ford to be launched after the Second World War, so it was from inception known within the company as Ford Project 7 (P7) or more simply as the Ford P7.
During the months following its introduction, sales were disappointing and the company rushed to produce an extensively face-lifted model. This appeared, with various styling changes and a modified range of engine options, in August 1968, less than a year after the P7’s introduction. To differentiate between the model produced before August 1968, and that produced between August 1968 and the end of 1971, the former is normally designated as the Ford P7a and the latter as the Ford P7b. The P7a had slightly different bodywork up front for the four-cylinder (17M) and six-cylinder (20M) models, with a 72 mm (2.8 in) longer front overhang. The P7b did away with this barely noticeable distinction.

However, its site may have been in use for similar purposes since the Anglo-Saxon period, and it may have been the earliest such residence outside Canterbury.
Archbishop John Morton (1486–1500) rebuilt the palace, adding a five-storey tower of brick, and Thomas Cranmer was visited there by King Henry VIII in 1544. In 1573 Archbishop Matthew Parker proposed to demolish it, but it survived to be surveyed in 1647 by commissioners acting on the instructions of the Long Parliament, which had acquired it from the Church of England. The survey found the palace to be in fair condition, but it was largely demolished and the materials sold by order of Parliament in 1658, while the see of Canterbury was vacant. Its site was returned to the Church after the Restoration. In 1661, what remained of it was described as so ruined that its chapel was in use as a barn.

861599.0,0,Ford Panther platform,"The Ford Panther platform was an automobile platform that was used by Ford Motor Company from the 1979 to 2012 model years.  Following the downsizing of the General Motors B-bodies and C-bodies by two years, the Panther platform marked the end of production of sedans unencumbered by downsizing.  Originally slated for discontinuation during the early 1980s, the Panther architecture was used for 33 model years, the longest-produced platform in North American automotive history.
Developed as a successor to the 1969 Ford chassis, the rear-wheel drive, body-on-frame Panther platform was used by the Ford and Lincoln-Mercury brands.  While produced exclusively as four-door sedans from 1992 to 2012, prior to its first update, the chassis underpinned two-door sedans and five-door station wagons.  Throughout its entire production life, all Panther-platform vehicles were equipped with a V8 engine; the Modular V8 engine was the first overhead-cam V8 engine used in an American vehicle.
Initially developed in response to the implementation of CAFE by the U.S. federal government, the Panther platform outlived its closest rival (the GM B platform) by 15 years, with the 2012 Ford Crown Victoria becoming the final mass-produced passenger car designed with a separate frame.  While body-on-frame construction is retained by pickup trucks and larger SUVs, unibody construction (or variants thereof) see nearly universal use in passenger cars.
From 1978 to 1985, Ford and Mercury versions of the Panther platform were assembled in Hazelwood, Missouri (St. Louis Assembly).  For the 1986 model year, production shifted to Talbotville, Ontario, Canada (St. Thomas Assembly) for the 1986 model year.  Lincoln versions were sourced from Wixom, Michigan (Wixom Assembly) until its 2007 closure; from 2008 to 2011, the Lincoln Town Car was assembled by St. Thomas Assembly.

The cemetery was originally 18 acres (73,000 m2) in size, but a further 16.5 acres (67,000 m2) were added in 1875. It came into use during one of the largest outbreaks of cholera in the country and during its first year it saw over 400 burials related to that disease. During Victorian times it was the main cemetery for the Three Towns, and it is estimated that approximately a quarter of a million people are buried within its grounds. The older burial records have been deposited with the Plymouth and West Devon Record Office.
Among the more famous graves is that of the Reverend Robert Stephen Hawker, the author of The Song of the Western Men.

After the original cemetery company went into liquidation and after much public debate, in 2000 a trust was set up which reopened the cemetery, made dangerous structures safe, cleared the undergrowth, obtained renovation grants and created a walking trail around some of the graves of notable people. The older of the two chapels which is shown above right in a photograph of its unrestored state has now been fully restored and refurbished as a setting for all varieties of religious or secular funeral or memorial services and is also used for concerts and other events.

The Pinto was marketed in three body styles through its production: a two-door fastback sedan with a trunk, a three-door hatchback, and a two-door station wagon. Mercury offered rebadged versions of the Pinto as the Mercury Bobcat from 1975 to 1980 (1974–1980 in Canada). Over three million Pintos were produced over its ten-year production run, outproducing the combined totals of its domestic rivals, the Chevrolet Vega and the AMC Gremlin. The Pinto and Mercury Bobcat were produced at Edison Assembly in Edison, New Jersey, St. Thomas Assembly in Southwold, Ontario, and San Jose Assembly in Milpitas, California.Since the 1970s, the safety reputation of the Pinto has generated controversy. Its fuel-tank design attracted both media and government scrutiny after several deadly fires related to the tanks rupturing occurred in rear-end collisions. A subsequent analysis of the overall safety of the Pinto suggested it was comparable to other 1970s subcompact cars. The safety issues surrounding the Pinto and the subsequent response by Ford have been cited widely as a business ethics as well as tort reform case study.",

The internal Ford codename for the unit was the T88-series engine. European Ford service literature refers to it as the Taunus In-Line engine (hence the TL codenames).  In North America it was known as the Lima In-Line (LL), or simply the Lima engine due to it being manufactured at Lima Engine in Lima, Ohio.
It was used in many European Ford cars and was exported to the United States to be used in the Ford Pinto, a successful subcompact car of the 1970s, hence the name which is used most often for the unit. In Britain, it is commonly used in many kit cars and hot rods, especially in the 2-litre size.

At the Piquette Avenue Plant, the company created and first produced the Ford Model T, the car credited with initiating the mass use of automobiles in the United States. Prior to the Model T, several other car models were assembled at the factory. Early experiments using a moving assembly line to make cars were also conducted there. It was also the first factory where more than 100 cars were assembled in one day. While it was headquartered at the Piquette Avenue Plant, Ford Motor Company became the biggest U.S.-based automaker, and it would remain so until the mid-1920s. The factory was used by the company until 1910, when its car production activity was relocated to the new, bigger Highland Park Ford Plant.
Studebaker bought the factory in 1911, using it to assemble cars until 1933. The building was sold in 1936, going through a series of owners for the rest of the 20th century before becoming a museum in 2001.

25470036.0,0,Ford PowerShift transmission,"The Ford PowerShift is a six- or seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, produced by the Ford Motor Company. The older Ford PowerShift gearboxes were built by Getrag Ford Transmissions, a joint-venture with Getrag, however it is unknown who exactly makes the newer 7-speed models. PowerShift improves fuel efficiency by as much as 10 percent when compared to a conventional automatic transmission.The operation of a dual-clutch transmission is analogous to two traditional manual transmissions, each with its own clutch, operating in parallel and alternating shifts. The Ford unit is a six-speed with one clutch acting on reverse, first, third, and fifth gears, and the other used for second, fourth, sixth gears. As the first gear is engaged, the 2-4-6 clutch is disengaged and the second gear cogs are engaged. At the appropriate time, the R-1-3-5 clutch is disengaged and the 2-4-6 clutch is engaged. While in second gear, the other side shifts from first to third. The process is repeated with none of the efficiency loss normally associated with torque converters and, in theory, provides quick smooth shifts.
The older PowerShift gearbox was developed jointly by Ford, Getrag, and LuK and was first introduced in Europe. Other manufacturers of dual-clutch transmissions such as Volkswagen and Volvo use wet-clutch technology.Some versions of the PowerShift transmission, including the 6DCT250 DPS6 version used in the Ford Fiesta and Ford Focus, used dry clutches and electric motor/solenoid actuation.  The transmission proved problematic even before it was released, with all installed units exhibiting failure behavior such as slipping or surging during launches, poor shift quality, and uncommanded shifts into neutral caused by overheating resulting in loss of power.  Investigations have revealed that Ford's engineers and management were aware of the transmission problems before and after launching, and knew that the transmission was not capable of achieving an acceptable operation, yet chose to use the transmission anyway.  Production workers have stated that cars with this transmission exhibited problems on their first drive off of the production line.",

During that time, Ford's marketing team had deemed that a front-wheel drive platform (borrowed Mazda GD and GE platforms) would have lower costs for production, and also because the platform had been gaining popularity with consumers.

6675449.0,0,Ford Quadricycle,"The Ford Quadricycle was the first vehicle developed by Henry Ford. Ford's first car was a simple frame with a gas-powered engine and four bicycle wheels mounted on it.The earliest cars were hand built, one by one, and very expensive. The peculiar machines were seen as toys for the rich.
In the 1890s, the ""horseless carriage"" was a relatively new idea, with no one having a fixed, universal idea of what a car should look like or how it should work. Most of the first car builders were inventors, rather than businessmen, working with their imaginations and the parts they had on hand.  Thus, the invention of the Quadricycle marks an important innovation as a proto-automobile that would lay the foundation for the future, with more practical designs to follow.
On June 4, 1896, in a tiny workshop behind his home on 58 Bagley Avenue, Detroit, where the Michigan Building now stands, Ford put the finishing touches on his pure ethanol-powered motor. After more than two years of experimentation, Ford, at the age of 32, had completed his first experimental automobile. He dubbed his creation the ""Quadricycle,"" so named because it ran on four bicycle tires, and because of the means through which the engine drove the back wheels. The success of the little vehicle led to the founding of the Detroit Automobile Company in 1899, followed by the Henry Ford Company in 1901 and then later the Ford Motor Company in 1903.The two cylinder engine could produce 4 horsepower. The  Quadricycle was driven by a chain. The transmission had only two gears (first for up to 10 mph (16 km/h), 2nd for up to 20 mph (32 km/h)), but did not have a reverse gear. The tiller-steered machine had wire wheels and a 3 US gal (11 L) fuel tank under the seat. Ford test drove it on June 4, 1896, after various test drives, achieving a top speed of 20 mph (32 km/h). Ford would later go on to found the Ford Motor Company and become one of the world's richest men.The original Quadricycle resides at The Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan.

4199744.0,0,Ford Reflex,"The Ford Reflex (or REFL3X, as spelled on the vehicle nameplate) is a concept car introduced at the 2006 North American International Auto Show that, according to Ford, ""proves small cars can be bold and American"". It is a technological showcase that includes solar panel-powered headlights, integrated child seat, baby cam with a monitor mounted on the dash, inflatable rear safety belts, and an interior quieted by ground rubber taken from Nike athletic shoe outsoles.  A production version of the Reflex design has not yet been announced.  It features an advanced diesel-electric hybrid engine with new-generation lithium ion batteries that help deliver up to 65 miles per US gallon (3.6 L/100 km; 78 mpg‑imp) of diesel fuel, and can accelerate the vehicle from 0 to 60 mph (97 km/h) in 7 seconds.

The concept features an electric motor on the rear axle in addition to its hybrid propulsion system on the front axle. The rear motor provides all wheel drive capability, improved driving dynamics, and the fuel economy benefits of a full hybrid vehicle.  Reflex's energy is stored in a new-generation lithium-ion battery pack, using the same technology found in cell phones. Ford was the first manufacturer to produce an electric vehicle using this type of battery system when it introduced the electric Ford Ka research vehicle in 2000. Also contributing to Reflex's power and performance are unique headlamps and taillamps that integrate solar panels. The Ford-patented battery-charging lighting system improves fuel economy by using the sun's power to charge the on-board batteries, while capturing and reusing the daylight at night.
The Reflex features 2+1 seating, with a center-mounted rear ""love seat"" for 2 children or one adult, that also includes a fold-out rear-facing child seat.  ""Ford Reflex is a small car that doesn't feel small,"" says Freeman Thomas, director, Ford North American Strategic Design. ""It is a gorgeous sporty car that delivers guilt free performance with a hybrid engine. And thanks to its innovative approach to the interior, it has space for growing families.""
Reflex is set off with Ford's three-bar grille – made of high-strength anodized extruded aluminum, which is hand polished to a matte finish. The concept's shoulder line flows upward to the B-pillar and back down into the wheel arch. Reverse butterfly doors aid vehicle ingress and egress.

The Reflex concept car is similar in size and general configuration as the Mazda Kabura concept, and if they are both ordered into production could share a common platform, with styling and powertrain differences to set the pair apart.  For example, while the Kabura concept included a 2.0L 16 valve DOHC piston inline-four engine, a production Kabura might end up with a rotary engine, as used in the Mazda RX-8.  The Reflex would likely have a more conventional gasoline or diesel (or hybrid) engine.",

It had a V8 gasoline engine with 3924 cm³ displacement, which initially produced 90 PS (66 kW) and was increased by 5 PS to 95 PS (70 kW) from 1949. The engine power was passed on to the rear wheels via a four or five-speed gearbox. All-wheel drive was also available on request.The trucks were usually delivered from the factory with an all-steel driver's cab in gray and a flatbed. The wheelbase was 4013 mm, the payload 3000 kg. From 1949, however, there were also two low-floor chassis for buses and special bodies with an extended wheelbase and front-link chassis with an engine built into the rear. Drauz or NWF built buses with up to 25 seats and 33 standing places on it.While the use of gasoline engines initially proved to be an advantage, because they could also be equipped with wood gas gasifiers to counter the petrol shortage, these models later found it difficult to prevail against competitors with diesel engines due to their high petrol consumption. Therefore, from January 1951, Ford also offered six-cylinder four-stroke diesel engines from Kämper or Hercules with a displacement of 4080 cm³ and 94 hp (69 kW). The engines were manufactured under license for Ford by Knorr in Munich. However, the engine proved to be very fragile and its output was therefore soon reduced to 85 hp (62.5 kW), albeit with little success: its reliability hardly increased.The successors, the FK 2500 to FK 4500, were equipped with two-stroke diesel engines.",

The early engines did not have a water pump as standard, instead relying on thermosiphon cooling as the Model T engine had. A water pump was added in 1953 for the 100E models when the engine was re-engineered to the point that few specifications are identical between the early and the later series. The Sidevalve engine was used in many smaller Fords as well as farm vehicles, commercial vehicles and a marine version in boats. Production of the engine was stopped in 1962.  Windscreen wipers were often driven by the vacuum generated in the inlet manifold.
The Sidevalve Engine was also used in German Fords, starting with the Ford Köln in 1932 and ending with the last rear-wheel drive Ford Taunus 12M (G13/G13AL) in 1962.

The Strike included picketing and eventually led to a two-day blockade of vehicles surrounding the Ford plant on November 5.The strike ended on December 19 as both sides agreed to a temporary agreement proposal, while arbitration regarding the implementation of a fully unionized shop and medical coverage continued under Justice Ivan C. Rand. His report was released on January 29, 1946. The Rand Formula, as it became known, was one result of his report. This gave the UAW formal recognition as the sole negotiators representing all employees of Ford Motor Company. This changed both collective bargaining and labour relations by legitimizing unions.",

The Super Duty trucks use a distinct chassis from the lighter F-150, with heavier-duty chassis and suspension components to allow for higher payload and towing capacities; additionally, the product line continued the use of Ford PowerStroke diesel engines. With a GVWR over 8,500 lb (3,900 kg), Super Duty pickups are class 2 and 3 trucks, while chassis cab trucks are class 4 and class 5. The F-Series Super Duty has been used as the base chassis of the Ford Excursion full-sized SUV.
Ford F-250 to F-550 Super Duty trucks are assembled at the Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, Kentucky, while medium-duty F-650 and F-750s are assembled at Ohio Assembly in Avon Lake, Ohio (prior to 2016, medium-duty trucks were assembled in the Blue Diamond Truck joint venture with Navistar in Mexico). As of 2016, the Ford Super Duty is sold in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Venezuela (F-250 and F-350), Suriname, Brazil (F-350/F-4000), Argentina (F-4000 only), Angola (F-250 and F-350), Cambodia, the Middle East, and Iceland (F-350 only) in left-hand drive (LHD) only.

In 2001, Hyundai unveiled the Wik Concept, a sturdy model for a new pure sports car, at the Frankfurt Motor Show.
The Wik Concept looks like a traditional sports coupe at first glance, but in fact it is a compact 4WD 2+2pack with more high-tech features than one might imagine.  The notion of a sports car with the capabilities of a pickup and SUV is about as extreme as a 'crossover' can get.The Wik was designed at Hyundai's European Design Centre in Frankfurt.

An Infiniti spokesperson said the vehicle shown is a ""production intent"" concept and will be on the market in 2014. In May 2013 the company said that it was waiting for inductive charging industry standards before launching the vehicle.The Infiniti LE Concept is based on the Nissan Leaf platform. However the LE concept is powered by a 100 kW (134 hp), 325 N⋅m (240 ft⋅lb) electric motor, rather than the 80 kW (107 hp), 285 N⋅m (210 ft⋅lb) motor used in the Leaf. Like the Leaf, the LE will also utilize a 24 kWh or larger lithium-ion battery pack mounted below the passenger compartment. Driving range on a single charge is estimated to be about 160 km (100 miles).  The LE is aerodynamically clean with its high rear deck, aero-treated wheels, rear diffuser, front spoiler and side spoilers to give a drag coefficient of Cd=0.25. The LE would mark the brand's first front-wheel drive car since the 2004 Infiniti I35 if the car goes into production.
A key feature of the LE is its inductive wireless charging. The vehicle can be charged by parking it over a charge point located in the floor, rather than plugging into an electrical outlet. However, the LE can also be charged through its CHAdeMO DC50kW quick charger.In June 2013, Infiniti CEO Johan de Nysschen said the Infiniti LE was on hold indefinitely as the Infiniti brand was attempting to triple sales by the 2017 fiscal year.In July 2013, Nissan's head of global planning Andy Palmer said the LE is ""not significantly"" on hold, but delayed ""a little bit"" so that Infiniti can incorporate some ""interesting advances in electric technology"" like new lithium ion battery technology that will increase range and lower the price.In July 2014, the LE was reported as in development again.

With a body length of up to 1.85 m (6 ft 1 in) and a weight of up to 96 kg (212 lb), it is the largest cat species in the Americas and the third largest in the world. Its distinctively marked coat features pale yellow to tan colored fur covered by spots that transition to rosettes on the sides, although a melanistic black coat appears in some individuals. The jaguar's powerful bite allows it to pierce the carapaces of turtles and tortoises, and to employ an unusual killing method: it bites directly through the skull of mammalian prey between the ears to deliver a fatal blow to the brain.
The modern jaguar's ancestors probably entered the Americas from Eurasia during the Early Pleistocene via the land bridge that once spanned the Bering Strait. Today, the jaguar's range extends from extreme southern Arizona and New Mexico in the United States across Mexico and much of Central America, the Amazon rainforest and south to Paraguay and northern Argentina. It inhabits a variety of forested and open terrains, but its preferred habitat is tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest, wetlands and wooded regions. It is adept at swimming and is largely a solitary, opportunistic, stalk-and-ambush apex predator. As a keystone species, it plays an important role in stabilizing ecosystems and in regulating prey populations.
The jaguar is threatened by habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, poaching for trade with its body parts and killings in human–wildlife conflict situations, particularly with ranchers in Central and South America. It has been listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List since 2002. The wild population is thought to have declined since the late 1990s.

It remained the only engine type available on Jaguar until 1999 with the launch of the S-Type, when the Jaguar AJ-V6 engine was added to the list. The AJ-V8 is available in displacements ranging from 3.2L to 5.0L, and a supercharged version is also produced. Ford Motor Company also used this engine in other cars, including the Lincoln LS and the 2002-2005 Ford Thunderbird, as well as in several Land Rovers, and the Aston Martin V8 Vantage.
The AJ-V8 was designed to use Nikasil-coated cylinders rather than the more-common iron cylinder liners. However, like the BMW M60, high-sulphur fuel reacted with the Nikasil coating and caused engine failures. Jaguar replaced affected engines, and has used conventional cast-iron linings ever since.
The engine originally used a two-state Variable Valve Timing system to switch the intake cam timing by 30°. Newer variants use a more sophisticated system which can vary intake timing incrementally up to 48°. The Lincoln version was made in the United States.
Other engine features include fracture-split forged powder metal connecting rods, a special one-piece cast camshaft, and reinforced plastic intake manifold.

Jaguar Cars was the company that was responsible for the production of Jaguar cars until its operations were fully merged with those of Land Rover to form Jaguar Land Rover on 1 January 2013.
Jaguar's business was founded as the Swallow Sidecar Company in 1922, originally making motorcycle sidecars before developing bodies for passenger cars. Under the ownership of S. S. Cars Limited, the business extended to complete cars made in association with Standard Motor Co, many bearing Jaguar as a model name. The company's name was changed from S. S. Cars to Jaguar Cars in 1945. A merger with the British Motor Corporation followed in 1966, the resulting enlarged company now being renamed as British Motor Holdings (BMH), which in 1968 merged with Leyland Motor Corporation and became British Leyland, itself to be nationalised in 1975.
Jaguar was spun off from British Leyland and was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1984, becoming a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index until it was acquired by Ford in 1990. Jaguar has, in recent years, manufactured cars for the British Prime Minister, the most recent delivery being an XJ in May 2010. The company also holds royal warrants from Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles.Ford owned Jaguar Cars, also buying Land Rover in 2000, until 2008 when it sold both to Tata Motors. Tata created Jaguar Land Rover as a subsidiary holding company. At operating company level, in 2013 Jaguar Cars was merged with Land Rover to form Jaguar Land Rover Limited as the single design, manufacture, sales company and brand owner for both Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles.
Since the Ford ownership era, Jaguar and Land Rover have used joint design facilities in engineering centres at Whitley in Coventry and Gaydon in Warwickshire and Jaguar cars have been assembled in plants at Castle Bromwich and Solihull.
On 15 February 2021 Jaguar Land Rover announced that all cars made under the Jaguar brand will be fully electric by 2025.",

The largest part (48%) of the jaguar’s geographical distribution, which extends from northern Argentina to the southwestern United States, lies within Brazil. However, although nationally considered endangered, until the foundation of the JCF few programs focusing on conservation of the species existed. Today, JCF is the only Brazilian NGO (non-governmental organization) devoted exclusively to promoting the conservation of the jaguar. It is currently implementing scientific research in four Brazilian biomes (Amazon, Cerrado, Caatinga and Pantanal) and supports partner organizations in the Atlantic Forest. Research topics include long-term population monitoring programs for jaguars and their main prey species, and management programs to solve the conflict between the predator and livestock ranchers. Additionally, JCF's projects of cultural, educational and social character contribute to conservation of the jaguar, biodiversity, and to reduction of the effects of global warming. In order to facilitate contact between non-Brazilian supporters/sponsors and JCF activities in Brazil, the Jaguar Conservation Fund –US was founded in 2004 as a 501©3 non-profit organization.",

Designed specifically to win the Le Mans 24-hour race, it shared the straight-6 XK engine and many mechanical components with its C-Type predecessor.  Its structure, however, was radically different, with innovative monocoque construction and slippery aerodynamics that integrated aviation technology, including in some examples a distinctive vertical stabilizer.
Engine displacement began at 3.4 litres, was enlarged to 3.8 L in 1957, and reduced to 3.0 L in 1958 when Le Mans rules limited engines for sports racing cars to that maximum. D-Types won Le Mans in 1955, 1956 and 1957. After Jaguar temporarily retired from racing as a factory team, the company offered the remaining unfinished D-Types as street-legal XKSS versions, whose perfunctory road-going equipment made them eligible for production sports car races in America.  In 1957 25 of these cars were in various stages of completion when a factory fire destroyed nine of them.
Total production is thought by some to have totaled 71 D-Types, including 18 for factory teams and 53 for privateers (plus an additional 16 D-Types were converted into road-legal XKSS versions).  Jaguar is quoted as claiming it built 75 D-Types.",

No ladder frame chassis, as was common at the time, was needed and as such the first cars weighed only 1315 kg (2900 lb).It is rumored that, on its release on 15 March 1961 Enzo Ferrari called it ""the most beautiful car ever made"", but this statement is not fully confirmed.

Jeep's current product range consists solely of sport utility vehicles – both crossovers and fully off-road worthy SUVs and models, including one pickup truck. Previously, Jeep's range included other pick-ups, as well as small vans, and a few roadsters. Some of Jeep's vehicles—such as the Grand Cherokee—reach into the luxury SUV segment, a market segment the 1963 Wagoneer is considered to have started. Jeep sold 1.4 million SUVs globally in 2016, up from 500,000 in 2008, two-thirds of which in North America, and was Fiat-Chrysler's best selling brand in the U.S. during the first half of 2017. In the U.S. alone, over 2400 dealerships hold franchise rights to sell Jeep-branded vehicles, and if Jeep were spun off into a separate company, it is estimated to be worth between $22 and $33.5 billion—slightly more than all of FCA (US).Prior to 1940 the term ""jeep"" had been used as U.S. Army slang for new recruits or vehicles, but the World War II ""jeep"" that went into production in 1941 specifically tied the name to this light military 4x4, arguably making them the oldest four-wheel drive mass-production vehicles now known as SUVs. The Jeep became the primary light 4-wheel-drive vehicle of the United States Armed Forces and the Allies during World War II, as well as the postwar period. The term became common worldwide in the wake of the war. Doug Stewart noted:
""The spartan, cramped, and unstintingly functional jeep became the ubiquitous World War II four-wheeled personification of Yankee ingenuity and cocky, can-do determination."" It is the precursor of subsequent generations of military light utility vehicles such as the Humvee, and inspired the creation of civilian analogs such as the original Series I Land Rover. Many Jeep variants serving similar military and civilian roles have since been designed in other nations.
The Jeep marque has been headquartered in Toledo, Ohio, ever since Willys–Overland launched production of the first CJ or Civilian Jeep branded models there in 1945. Its replacement, the conceptually consistent Jeep Wrangler series, remains in production since 1986. With its solid axles and open top, the Wrangler has been called the Jeep model that is as central to the brand's identity as the 911 is to Porsche.At least two Jeep models (the CJ-5 and the SJ Wagoneer) enjoyed extraordinary three-decade production runs of a single body generation.
In lowercase, the term ""jeep"" continues to be used as a generic term for vehicles inspired by the Jeep that are suitable for use on rough terrain.
In Iceland the word Jeppi (derived from Jeep) has been used since WWII and is still used for any type of SUV.",

The 1945 Willys Jeep was the world's first mass-produced civilian four-wheel drive car.
In 1944, Willys-Overland, one of the two main manufacturers of the World War II military Jeep, built the first prototypes for a commercial version – the CJ, short for ""civilian Jeep"". From then on, all CJ Jeeps consistently had a separate body and frame, rigid live axles with leaf springs both front and rear, a tapering nose design with flared fenders, and a fold-flat windshield, and could be driven without doors. Also, with few exceptions, they had part-time four-wheel drive systems, with the choice of high and low gearing, and open bodies with removable hard or soft tops.
After remaining in production through a range of model numbers, and several corporate parents, the Jeep CJ line was officially ended in 1986. More than 1.5 million CJ Jeeps were built, having continued the same basic body style for 45 years since the Jeep first appeared. Widely regarded as ""America's workhorse"", the CJs have been described as ""probably the most successful utility vehicle ever made."" American Motors VP Joseph Cappy said the end of ""CJ production will signal an end of a very important era in Jeep history."" The Jeep CJ-7 was replaced in 1987 by the similar-looking Jeep Wrangler.
The similar model, the DJ ""Dispatcher"" was introduced in 1956 as a two-wheel drive version with open, fabric, or a closed steel body in both left- and right-hand drives for hotel, resort, police, and later United States Postal Service markets.",

Jeep marketed XJs as Sportwagons, precursor to the modern sport utility vehicle (SUV), before that term was used.

The Wrangler is arguably an indirect progression from the World War II Jeep, through the CJ (Civilian Jeeps) produced by Willys, Kaiser-Jeep and American Motors Corporation (AMC) from the mid-1940s through 1980s. Although neither AMC nor Chrysler (after its purchase of AMC in 1987) have claimed that the Wrangler was a direct descendant of the original military model — both the CJ Jeeps and the conceptually consistent Wrangler, with their solid axles and open top, have been called the Jeep model as central to Jeep's brand identity as the rear-engined 911 is to Porsche.Similar to the Willys MB and the CJ Jeeps before it, all Wrangler models continue to use a separate body and frame, rigid live axles both front and rear, a tapering nose design with flared fenders, a fold-flat windshield, and can be driven without doors. Also, with few exceptions, they have part-time four-wheel drive systems, with the choice of high and low gearing, and standard are open bodies with removable hard- or soft-tops. However, the Wrangler series was specifically redesigned to be safer and more comfortable on-road, to attract more daily drivers, by upgrading its suspension, drivetrain, and interior, compared to the CJ line. The suspension on all Wranglers included trackbars and anti-roll bars, and, from the 1997 TJ onwards, front and rear coil springs instead of the previous leaf-springs.From 2004 on, the Wrangler has been complemented with long-wheelbase versions, called Wrangler Unlimited. 2004-2006 models were longer versions with 2 doors. In 2004 only automatic transmission-equipped “Unlimited” versions were sold. In 2005 both an automatic and manual 6-speed (NSG-370) were offered. Since 2007, the long-wheelbase Wranglers were four-door models, offering over 20 in (508 mm) more room.

The jeep can only carry a fixed and limited amount of fuel, but it can leave fuel and collect fuel at fuel dumps anywhere in the desert.
The problem first appeared in the 9th-century collection Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes (Problems to Sharpen the Young), attributed to Alcuin.  The De viribus quantitatis (c. 1500) of Luca Pacioli also discusses the problem.  A modern treatment was given by N. J. Fine in 1947.The jeep problem is related to several other optimization problems:

The camel and bananas problem is a mathematics problem in which a merchant must maximize the number of bananas transported to a market using a camel that needs to eat bananas to move. The camel can only carry a fixed and limited amount of bananas, but the merchant can leave bananas and collect them anywhere in the desert.
The travelers across the desert problem, is a mathematics problem that asks for the minimum number of accompanying travelers needed to reach another base far away, without starving any traveler on the way. Each traveler can only carry a fixed and limited amount of supplies, and can't leave supplies in the desert to pick up later. However, accompanying travelers can transfer supplies among themselves.

He is well known for using influences from American comics, television, and films in his work, and describes himself as a big fan of Batman and Star Wars. One of the most widely published Japanese manga artist, nearly all of his stories have been translated into other languages, including English. His two most successful and popular manga series to-date are Martian Successor Nadesico and Silent Möbius.
Before becoming a manga artist, Asamiya graduated from the Tokyo Designer School, then worked as a character designer for a number of anime series, and even designed models for some of the later Godzilla films (1980s). For this career, he used his real name, and maintained the two professional identities separately for many years. Several of the anime series that he worked on were very popular inside and outside Japan, most notably Sonic Soldier Borgman and Project A-ko. Even after focusing primarily on his manga career, Asamiya continued to do character designs and creative consultation on anime series based on his stories, occasionally under the Kikuchi name.
In the early 2000s, Asamiya has shifted his focus from teenage and young-adult stories to stories designed for children and for an American audience. In the former case, he credits his children as a motivation but, in the latter case, he points to a long-standing desire to work with his favorite American characters. To that end, he has worked on projects with Image Comics, Marvel Comics, and DC Comics, as well as developing a manga adaptation of the film Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace.
While many Japanese artists (and artists in general) are quite reclusive, Asamiya often makes an effort to be available to his fans. He maintains a website with news and information about his studio, TRON (named after the Disney film Tron). He aids and assists his official fan club by sending them regular announcements and limited-edition merchandise. Despite these actions, he shunned all public photography and had the habit of depicting himself with a placeholder sign for a face. It has become a trademark feature of his books that instead of a picture of the artist, there is an elaborately decorated rectangle sporting the words ""Now Printing"" (a message used in Japan for placeholder images).",

The new inline-four engines included Hyundai's new turbocharged 3.3 L D4AL and 3.9 L D4DA, producing 120 PS (88 kW) and 140 PS (103 kW) respectively.

18329.0,0,Lexus,"Lexus (レクサス, Rekusasu) is the luxury vehicle division of the Japanese automaker Toyota. The Lexus brand is marketed in more than 90 countries and territories worldwide and is Japan's largest-selling make  of premium cars. It has ranked among the 10 largest Japanese global brands in market value. Lexus is headquartered in Nagoya, Japan. Operational centers are located in Brussels, Belgium, and Plano, Texas, United States.
Created at around the same time as Japanese rivals Honda and Nissan created their Acura and Infiniti luxury divisions respectively, Lexus originated from a corporate project to develop a new premium sedan, code-named F1, which began in 1983 and culminated in the launch of the Lexus LS in 1989. Subsequently, the division added sedan, coupé, convertible and SUV models. Lexus did not exist as a brand in its home market until 2005, and all vehicles marketed internationally as Lexus from 1989 to 2005 were released in Japan under the Toyota marque and an equivalent model name. In 2005, a hybrid version of the RX crossover debuted and additional hybrid models later joined the division's lineup. Lexus launched its own F marque performance division in 2007 with the debut of the IS F sport sedan, followed by the LFA supercar in 2009.
Lexus vehicles are largely produced in Japan, with manufacturing centered in the Chūbu and Kyūshū regions, and in particular at Toyota's Tahara, Aichi, Chūbu and Miyata, Fukuoka, Kyūshū plants. Assembly of the first Lexus produced outside the country, the Canadian-built RX 330, began in 2003. Following a corporate reorganization from 2001 to 2005, Lexus began operating its own design, engineering and manufacturing centers.
Since the 2000s, Lexus has increased sales outside its largest market, the United States. The division inaugurated dealerships in the Japanese domestic market in 2005, becoming the first Japanese premium car marque to launch in its country of origin. The brand has since debuted in Southeast Asia, Latin America, Europe and other regions, and has introduced hybrid vehicles in many markets.",

It was sanctioned by the LPGA Tour, but any winnings were unofficial and were not included in the LPGA money list standings.
The title sponsor was Lexus, a luxury automobile maker. It was one many new team golf tournaments founded on the model of the Ryder Cup since that tournament became a star attraction in golf in the 1980s. In women's golf it complemented the Solheim Cup, which is contested by teams from United States and Europe.
The inaugural Cup was held 9–11 December 2005, with a total purse of US$960,000 ($50,000 to each member of the winning team and $30,000 to members of the losing team).
In 2005, the two team captains were chosen early in the year and selected the players that made up their respective teams.  Starting in 2006 a qualifying system was used, with each team composed of the top four players from the Women's World Golf Rankings, the top four remaining players from the ADT Official Money List, two sponsor's picks, and two captain's picks.The tournament was a series of match play matches played over three days, Friday through Sunday, with each golfer playing every day. The Friday schedule had six foursomes matches; Saturday had six four-balls; and 12 singles matches are played on Sunday. This was a format modified from the Presidents Cup. If the scores were tied at the end of the singles matches, the captains competed in a sudden-death playoff.
A foursomes match is a competition between two teams of two golfers. The golfers on the same team take alternate shots on each hole with the same ball, with one golfer teeing off on all odd-numbered holes and the other teeing off on even-numbered holes. Each hole is won by the team that completes the hole in the fewest strokes. A four-ball match is also a competition between two teams of two golfers, but all four golfers play their own balls throughout the round rather than alternating shots, and each hole is won by the team whose individual golfer has the lowest score. A singles match is a standard matchplay competition between two golfers.",

The first five generations of the ES were built on the Toyota Camry platform, with the sixth and seventh generations more closely related to the Avalon. Manual transmissions were offered until 1993, a lower-displacement inline-four engine became an option in Asian markets in 2010, and a gasoline-electric hybrid version was introduced in 2012. The ES was Lexus' only front-wheel drive vehicle until 1998, when the related RX was introduced, and the sedan occupied the entry-level luxury car segment of the Lexus lineup in North America and other regions until the debut of the IS in 1999. The ES name stands for ""Executive Sedan"". However, some Lexus importers use the backronymic name, ""Elegant Sedan"".Introduced in 1989, the first generation ES 250 was one of two vehicles in Lexus' debut lineup, the other being the flagship LS 400. The second generation ES 300 debuted in 1991, followed by the third generation ES 300 in 1996, and the fourth generation ES 300/330 in 2001. The first- through fourth generation sedans shared body styling elements with Japan-market Toyota sedans, and a domestic market equivalent, the Toyota Windom (Japanese: トヨタ・ウィンダム, Toyota Windamu), was sold until the launch of the fifth generation ES in 2006. The word ""Windom"" is a combination of ""win"" and the suffix ""dom"" expresses a state of perpetual victory.

The sixth generation ES debuted in the first half of 2012 as a 2013 model, and features increased cabin dimensions due to a longer wheelbase which is shared with the full-size XX40 series Avalon.
Lexus has positioned the ES in the comfort luxury segment, with an emphasis on interior amenities, quietness, and ride quality, in contrast with more firm-riding sport sedans. Buyers seeking more performance-focused models are targeted by the Lexus IS and rival makes, with such models offering a sportier drive with differently tuned suspensions. In Europe, Japan and other markets where it was not available until the seventh generation model, the GS sport sedans occupy the mid-size category in the Lexus lineup until it was cancelled August 2020.

30864558.0,0,Lexus RX,"The Lexus RX (Japanese: レクサス・RX, Hepburn: Rekusasu RX) is a mid-size luxury crossover SUV sold since 1998 by Lexus, a luxury division of Toyota. Originally released in its home market of Japan in late 1997 as the Toyota Harrier, export sales began in March 1998 as the Lexus RX. Four generations of the Lexus RX have been produced to date, the first being compact in size, and the latter three classified as mid-size. Both front- and four-wheel drive configurations have been used on the RX series, and several gasoline powertrain options, including V6 engines and hybrid systems, have been offered. In the Lexus model lineup, the RX sits below the larger GX and LX (marketed as the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado and the Toyota Land Cruiser body-on-frame SUVs outside North America), and above the smaller NX crossover with a lesser displacement inline-four engine. The name ""RX"" stands for ""Radiant Crossover"". It has also been labelled as ""Recreational Cross Country"" in some markets. The RX's current Toyota counterparts are the Highlander/Kluger; past counterparts were the Harrier and Venza.
The first-generation RX 300, fitted with a 3.0-liter V6 engine, began sales in 1998. The Japanese market Toyota Harrier released in 1997 also offered a 2.2-liter inline-four, later uprated to 2.4-liters. The second-generation RX 300 (3.0-liter V6) and RX 330 (3.3-liter V6) models went on sale in 2003, with both variants supplanted by the more powerful RX 350 (3.5-liter V6) in 2006. Like the previous series, a 2.4-liter inline-four engine was sold alongside the 3.0-liter V6 in the Japanese market Toyota Harrier. In 2005, a hybridized gasoline-electric version of the 3.3-liter second-generation model was made available as the RX 400h in export markets and as the Harrier Hybrid in Japan. For the third iteration released in 2009, both RX 350 (3.5-liter V6) and RX 450h (3.5-liter V6 hybrid) models were initially offered, with an entry-level RX 270 (2.7-liter inline-four) offered by Lexus in some Asian markets, including in Japan, since 2010. Since the release of the third generation, Japanese sales have occurred under the Lexus RX name as opposed to Toyota Harrier as had been the case previously.
The RX has been assembled at Toyota Motor Kyushu since launch. The RX and RX Hybrid were the first Lexus models to be built outside Japan, with North American market versions produced at the Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada plant in Cambridge, Ontario beginning 2003 (RX) and expanded in 2014 (RX Hybrid).

The first-generation SC debuted as the V8-powered SC 400 in 1991, and the I6-powered SC 300 was added in 1992. Both first-generation models were produced until 2000. The second-generation model, the SC 430, went into production in 2001. The SC 430 features a hardtop convertible design and a V8 engine. The first-generation SC was largely styled in California at Calty, and the second-generation SC was mainly conceived at design studios in Europe.
In Japan, the related third-generation Toyota Soarer, with which the first-generation SC originally shared body design and multiple components, featured a separate line-up of vehicle configurations and different powertrains. The third generation Soarer sport coupe, largely identical to the SC 430, was superseded by its Lexus counterpart in Japan when the Lexus marque débuted there in 2005.

The development of the 200S, codenamed Tipo 52 started in 1952, led by Giulio Alfieri. In response to Ferrari's 500 Mondial racing car which featured a 4 cylinder engine and was quite successful in sports car racing. The car had a 1,994.3 cc (2.0 L) inline-four light-alloy engine, featuring dual Overhead valves per cylinder and DOHC camshafts, double Weber 50DCO3 (first few cars only) or 45DCO3 carburetors. The engine was rated at 190 PS (140 kW; 187 hp) at 7,500 rpm. Many chassis components were identical to the Maserati 150S in order to speed up development, except the rigid rear axle inherited from the Maserati A6.

Maserati made the first three chassis internally, but outsourced a tubular chassis to Gilco which was modified by Maserati. The first five aluminum bodies were made by Celestino Fiandri, and the 23 final bodies were made by Medardo Fantuzzi.
The 200S debuted at the 1955 Imola Grand Prix, driven Franco Bordoni, but yielded disappointing results. The 200S was then entered at the 1955 Targa Florio driven by Giovanni Bracco and Bordoni along with a 150S. Both cars were forced to retire, with Maserati winning the race with a A6GCS driven by Francesco Giardini. 
In 1956, Maserati entered three new 200S' at the Supercortemaggiore GP. Problems with the suspension would be resolved by fitting two cars with a De dion bridge attached to the differential with a sliding pin at the rear. The third car had a conventional rear axle. The first car suffered damage in practicing round while the second one would retire during the race after only one lap. The third car would finish 27 seconds behind the winning Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa. At the Bara GP, the car would show more promising results by winning the race outright.In 1957 a new variant called the Maserati 200SI, Sport Internazionale, was introduced to conform to international sports car racing rules. The SI featured a wider windscreen, wipers, doors and a neat hood design to keep the rain out when the car was parked rather than protecting the driver from these elements during a race. The 200S was replaced by the 250S which featured an enlarged 2,498 cc (2.5 L) engine. Most of the 250S cars were 150S and 200S converted to 250S specifications.

The 350S was built to experiment with a new straight-six engine while a V8 engine was being developed in the factory. 
The engine used in the car was heavily revised for racing purposes and the completed unit shared little resemblance to the engine it was based on. Two different variants were made. One featured a dry sump lubrication system while the other features a wet sump lubrication system. The power outputs of the engine varied from 290 to 325 hp (216 to 242 kW). The engine was installed in a strengthened chassis of a 300S.The first chassis #3501 was developed in 1955, using the chassis of a 300S, and the 3.5-litre straight-six engine under development for the future 3500 GT. It was crashed by Stirling Moss in the 1956 Mille Miglia, then factory rebuilt as the first 450S prototype fitted with a V8 engine.

Development of the 450S started in 1954 under the codename Tipo 54 led by Vittorio Bellentani and Guido Taddeucci. Their intent was to use larger engines than those then used by Maserati.
The initial development began with the engine, which was a 4,477 cc (4.5 L) short-stroke V8 with four 45 IDM  Weber carburetors mounted between the Vee, a bore x stroke of 93.8mm x 81mm and double overhead camshafts rated at 400 hp (300 kW) at 7,200 rpm.The Tipo 54 project was shelved in 1955 after a catastrophic crash at LeMans. In early 1956, Tony Parravano, a wealthy American housing developer, commissioned Maserati to build a new large-bore V8 engine for use in a Kurtis Indy chassis. This prompted Maserati to start working on the Tipo 54 project once again. A 350S chassis numbered 3501 was selected for testing the new engine and was elongated in order to accommodate the engine. Valerio Colotti designed the tubular frame for the chassis. The independent front suspension with double wishbones and coil-springs were retained but a much reinforced de Dion rear-end, based around a new five-speed transaxle were added. This transaxle was mounted ahead of the de Dion tube and the gearbox section was extended ahead of the final-drive instead of being integrated on the right-hand side. The drum brakes were borrowed from a 300S with improved cooling. The car had an open top body designed by Medardo Fantuzzi resembling the 300S.

The prototype made its racing debut at the 1956 Swedish Grand Prix, with the chassis being renumbered as 4501. But due to the car still being in development phase, it showed various shortcomings despite its impressive performance. The chassis proved unable to handle the power output of the V8 and the wrong firing order of the engine resulted in intolerable vibration, hampering the performance of the car. The prototype qualified third in the practice round but was not entered in the race and was instead sent back to the factory where a purpose built chassis having the same number as the prototype was constructed.4501 was later entered at the 1957 Buenos Aires 1,000 km driven by Stirling Moss and Juan Manuel Fangio. A clutch failure after a very promising start prevented the car from commencing the season with a win. The car was redesigned as a coupé by Frank Costin of England, constructed by Zagato, and raced once again by Moss at Le Mans where it failed to finish due to major design flaws. The car was restored by Medardo Fantuzzi of Maserati (given a new chassis number 4512); and subsequently received another restoration by Faralli & Mazzanti being converted into a road car.Chassis #4503, driven by Fangio and Jean Behra, won the 12 Hours of Sebring. It was then crashed by Behra during practice for the Mille Miglia and didn't start the race. Repaired, it was again crashed by Behra at the Le Mans 24 Hours before it won again in the hands of Behra and Moss in the Swedish Sports Car Grand Prix. In the final race of the 1957 season the Venezuelan Sports Car Grand Prix it was destroyed before being later rebuilt.Chassis #4505 driven by Moss and Denis Jenkinson raced in the Mille Miglia until the brake pedal fell off. At the Nürburgring 1000km it was driven by Moss and Fangio and recorded another DNF when a wheel dropped off. The car was later sold to Temple Buell, who fitted it with a 5.7-litre engine and sold it to Jim Hall.
Chassis #4507 was driven by Moss and Harry Schell at the Venezuelan Sports Car Grand Prix where it was destroyed in a fiery crash that also involved chassis #4503.

Maserati finished the 1957 season as runners up to Ferrari in the World Sports Car Championship, its two victories at Sebring and Kristianstad, together with a second place at Buenos Aires and fourth in the Mille Miglia by its sister 300S gave Maserati a total of 25 points. Unfortunately for Maserati this was five behind Ferrari's winning total of 30 points gained from victories at Buenos Aires, the Mille Miglia and Venezuela together with a second place at the Nürburgring and Sweden.

Other cars were sold to the following: Chassis #4502 to Tony Parravano, #4505 to Jim Kimberley and  #4506 to John Edgar. Chassis #4509 and #4510 was sold to the US, some having engine expansions to 5.7-and 6.6-litres and used in SCCA races by Carroll Shelby, Jim Hall, Masten Gregory, Walt Cline and Ebb Rose. Chassis #4512 was originally #4501.
The 450S was raced in the 1957 World Sports Car Championship where its principal rivals were Ferrari with its Ferrari 290 MM, 315 S and 335 S models, the Jaguar D-Type and the Aston Martin DBR1. Maserati stopped entering the 450S into competition when all of the race cars entered crashed at the 1957 World Sports Car Championship causing financial troubles for the company.Between 1956 and 1962, the 450S had 119 appearances, 31 of these being victories. The 450S' racing career ended when a new 3-litre regulation was enforced for the World Sportscar Championship.In 2015, Zagato released a car inspired by the 450S Costin Zagato Coupe at the Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este: the Zagato Maserati Mostro.

The Barchetta had a backbone chassis made of aluminium which was unusual for a Maserati automobile for a time considering that the cars offered by Maserati had a steel unibody construction. It had a Formula 1 suspension geometry and body panels made of carbon fibre which resulted in a total weight of 775 kg (1,709 lb). The Barchetta was one of the last Maserati models built under De Tomaso ownership.

16 examples of the racing model were produced by hand at the De Tomaso factory in Modena, plus two prototypes (one racing-corsa, one street-stradale model). It featured a mid-mounted Maserati AM501 V6 engine displacing 1,996 cc and was shared with the local 2.0 L engine offered in the Italian market on the Biturbo and the Ghibli. The engine had a peak power output of 319 PS (235 kW; 315 hp) at 7,250 rpm. The engine was mated to a 6-speed manual transmission manufactured by ZF Friedrichshafen and having straight cut gears. These modifications allowed the car to attain a top speed of 290 km/h (180 mph). Having a true open top design, driver protection was only provided by a small air deflector.The central-frame concept was carried over in the De Tomaso Guarà, but the frame was around 130 mm (5.1 in) longer because it was fitted with a larger V8 engine.
This was thought as a way to inject much needed excitement and enthusiasm for Maserati that saw its reputation badly ruined by years of exciting but maintenance sensitive products, eventually culminating in Maserati's withdrawal from the North American market at this time.",

The Camoradi team became famous racing the Tipo 61s but, despite being very competitive, the Birdcage was somewhat unreliable and retired from many races due to problems with the drivetrain.The road legal version of the Maserati MC 12 was available in a white colour with blue stripes livery as a tribute to the Tipo 61 and the Camoradi racing team.The Tipo 60/61 were succeeded by the Tipo 151 which used a more conventional tubular chassis.

The in-house developed engine displaced 482 cc and produced 9.4 PS (6.9 kW), powering the rear wheels through a three-speed transmission. Over the years, it would be produced in different variants and spawned other similar designs such as the Hopestar and Daihatsu Midget. A more powerful version called the DB soon appeared, and a number of other Mazda-Go iterations like the DC and the heavier KC types. The last version to appear before the war was the 1938 GA-type, which re-entered production in December 1945 as Mazda's first post-war product. The GA has a 669 cc sidevalve single-cylinder engine producing 13.7 PS (10.1 kW) and a cargo load of 500 kg (1,100 lb) while it itself weighed in at 580 kg (1,280 lb).The Mazda-Go range was replaced in the post-war era by an entire range of three-wheeled Mazda trucks, including the K360 and the Mazda T-2000 (ja).

8013759.0,0,Mazda (disambiguation),"Mazda may refer to:

Mazda, a Japanese automobile manufacturer
Ahura Mazda, the primary deity of Zoroastrianism
Mazda (light bulb), a trademarked name used on incandescent light bulbs and electronic tubes",
3058228.0,0,Mazda (light bulb),"Mazda was a trademarked name registered by General Electric (GE) in 1909 for incandescent light bulbs. The name was used from 1909 to 1945 in the United States by GE and Westinghouse. Mazda brand light bulbs were made for decades after 1945 outside the US.  The company chose the name due to its association with Ahura Mazda, the transcendental and universal God of Zoroastrianism whose name means light of wisdom in the Avestan language.
In 1909 the Mazda name was created for the tungsten filament light bulb.  GE sold bulbs under this trademark starting in 1909. GE promoted the mark as identifying tungsten filament bulbs with predictable performance and life expectancy.  GE also licensed the Mazda name, socket sizes, and tungsten filament technology to other manufacturers to establish a standard for lighting.  Bulbs were soon sold by many manufacturers with the Mazda name licensed from GE, including British Thomson-Houston in the United Kingdom, Toshiba in Japan, and GE's chief competitor Westinghouse.

Tungsten-filament bulbs of the Mazda type were initially more costly than carbon filament bulbs, but used less electricity. Often electrical utilities would trade new lamps for consumers' burned-out bulbs. In at least one case the authority regulating energy rates required the utility to use only tungsten bulbs so as not to inflate customer's energy use.
The company dropped the campaign in 1945.  GE's patents on the tungsten filament lamp expired in the late 1930s and other forms of lighting were becoming more important than incandescent bulbs.  GE stopped licensing the trademark to other manufacturers, although it continued to renew the trademark registration up to 1990. The registration on trademark no. 77,779 expired in 2000. Modern association of the Mazda name is mostly with the Mazda automobile manufacturer of Japan (which coexisted with Toshiba's Mazda bulbs in its early years). The Mazda trademark is split between the Japanese manufacturer where it applies to automobiles (including automobile lights and batteries) and GE for non-automotive uses.
GE's Mazda bulbs were manufactured by Minneapolis Mazda Lamp Works at a factory in Northeast Minneapolis. From the 1930s until 2012, the building was the headquarters of Minneapolis Public Schools.",

 Originally, the Chantez had been planned to use a single-rotor Wankel engine, but the other Kei manufacturers considered this unfair and blocked Mazda's plans.

The K-series also features a highly rigid aluminum split-crankcase engine block design with 4-bolt mains with additional bolts securing the lower block, an internally balanced forged steel crankshaft with lightweight powder forged carbon steel connecting rods. They were designed with the intent of being as compact as possible for short-hood front-wheel drive applications.
One unique innovation of the K-series was the introduction of Variable Resonance Induction System (VRIS). Based on the Helmholtz resonance principle, the intake manifold is equipped with 3 chambers tuned to a specific resonant frequency. The computer dynamically switches between each resonant chamber to achieve the appropriate resonant frequency for the engine's rpm. This effect optimizes volumetric efficiency over a given rpm range to provide maximum torque over the entire rpm range. VRIS is used on the K8, KF, and KL but nearly all modern Mazda V6s are now using this technology.
The K-series all have a 7,000 rpm redline with 7500-7800 rpm limiter, which given the engine design is conservative. The KJ-ZEM Miller cycle engine had a 6,000 rpm redline, but was only available with an automatic transmission.",

The Mazda Lantis used Mazda's CB platform, which means close relations to the Eunos 500/Xedos 6 and the 1994-1997 Mazda Capella.  It was an FF layout car with either a manual or automatic transmission.
The body variant is what Mazda called a ""4-door coupé"", which in common terminology is a 5-door hatchback. In Europe the 5-door hatchback was designated BA, but was actually almost identical to the CB, and had little to do with other B platforms.
The 5-door was sold as the Mazda 323F in Europe, Artis in Chile and Allegro Hatchback (HB) in Colombia and a few other countries of Latin America. This model was penned by Ginger (Arnold) Ostle, who worked for Porsche before arriving at Mazda.
The Mazda 323F features power steering, electrically adjustable mirrors, central locking and power windows. Another noticeable feature are the frameless windows, similar to the Nissan Presea.
By the time the cars premiered in August 1993, Mazda's multi-brand strategy had become difficult to sustain, so both Lantis variants were released to Mazda, Efini and Eunos dealerships. Sales in Japan were lacklustre throughout the Lantis' production run, but the 323F proved to be immensely popular in Europe and some Latin America countries, where it sold in reasonable numbers right until it was discontinued. The JDM Lantis was a popular used export to New Zealand.
The rare Type-R version of the Mazda Lantis was sold in Japan only and could be obtained in Europe and other parts of the world through import. The Type-R features a 170ps 2.0L KF-ZE V6 engine, Limited-Slip Differential and appearance options like a front lip spoiler, side skirts, floating rear spoiler, coloured front indicators and other modifications.
The name Lantis is created from the Latin phrase ""Latens Curtis"", which roughly translates as ""To secretly shorten"".
Although the 323F lacks a badge indicating which engine is fitted, the V6 version is easily recognizable since it is the only 323F with 5 stud hubs.
The South African and possibly other versions of the 323F branded as the Astina do include badges on the back indicating the engine capacity. The 1.8l is displayed with a badge reading 180 for example.",

731096.0,0,Mazda Millenia,"The Mazda Millenia is an automobile which was manufactured by Mazda in Japan from 1993 to 2002.
The Millenia was originally planned as the second of three models for Mazda's proposed luxury brand Amati. As the company's dwindling finances caused by the onslaught of the ""bubble economy"" prevented the launch of the Amati brand, the Millenia was released in the autumn of 1993 in Europe as the Mazda Xedos 9 and in Japan and Australia as the Eunos 800. The car was launched in North America in 1995 as the Mazda Millenia and in July 1997 the Japanese market Eunos 800 was also renamed to Mazda Millenia as Mazda discontinued the Eunos brand. There was no model link to the other Mazda marque, Ẽfini.
Having been developed for a separate market from typical Mazda customers, the Millenia boasted myriad finer details. It was engineered to far greater levels of perceived quality than existing Mazda cars, such as interior plastic quality, panel gap and thicker paint coating. The Millenia/Eunos 800/Xedos 9 was assembled along with the smaller Eunos 500/Mazda Xedos 6 in a new production line, presumably set up for Amati cars.
The Millenia does not have a direct predecessor or replacement in the Mazda product line, and production ceased with the introduction of the Mazda6 in 2002, itself a replacement for the 626. It appears to have received a brand-new platform, although the multi-link suspension at both ends strongly resembled that of the 1991 Mazda Sentia, with minor changes such as replacing the lower I-arm with an A-arm for front wheel drive. It was the only production car in the world to employ a Miller cycle engine (The current Demio/Mazda2 features Miller Cycle on one of its engines). Yaw-sensitive four-wheel steering was available as an option in Japan; Mazda claimed that with this feature, the Millenia was capable of passing the elk test at speeds comparable to the BMW 850i and Nissan 300ZX.
The 1997 Japanese market name change from Eunos 800 to Mazda Millenia was accompanied by a significant facelift that included some cost-saving measures. For instance, the hood was downgraded from aluminum to steel. The Millenia was again facelifted for the 2000 model year.

8945036.0,0,Mazda Nagare,"The Mazda Nagare (マツダ・流, Matsuda Nagare) (pronounced “nah-gah-reh”) is a concept car that was introduced by Mazda at the 2006 Los Angeles Auto Show.  The Nagare is considered to be an exercise in natural and organic car design to explore the future of Mazda automobiles.  Its name “Nagare” translates into English as “flow” and the designers specifically studied motion and the effect it has on natural surroundings when creating this vehicle.
It was designed by Laurens van den Acker, Mazda's global design director at the time (since replaced by Ikuo Maeda), and his advanced design studio team in Irvine, California.  As head of the international Nagare design team, Laurens’ main task from Mazda was to design first and engineering later. He has since been replaced by Ikuo Maeda.
“The Nagare is a celebration of proportions and surface language that will evolve into subsequent designs planned for presentation at future international auto shows.  Nagare examines light and shadow, and begins to reveal the global design cues for the next generation of Mazda vehicles,” said Laurens.  “We’re looking well down the road with Nagare. We want to suggest where Mazda design will be in 2020.  To do that, we redefined basic proportions and the idea of driving without losing the emotional involvement.  Mazda’s driving spirit will be enhanced and intensified by Nagare.”",

In 1974, the Parkway was installed with the 13B rotary engine and well as a 2000cc gasoline type ""VA"" and the diesel 2500cc type ""XA"". It also offered a novel transmission approach added to the manual transmission installed, called a sub transmission to cope with the load carrying requirements, and a fluid coupling to preventing engine stalling, knocking and oscillation. The rotary-powered minibus was called the Parkway Rotary 26, and could accommodate 26 passengers, even though it weighed 2,835 kg (6,250 lb), and could achieve a maximum speed of 120 km/h (75 mph). It was introduced July 22, 1974 and the rotary engine was replaced with a more conventional diesel engine in 1977.The Parkway Rotary was built only for the Japanese market, and certain aspects concerning its lack of speed become evident once it was realized that urban two-way streets are usually zoned at 40 km/h (25 mph) or less, as mentioned in the article Speed limits in Japan.

It is a rebodied Capella/626 with more luxurious equipment. The Persona was Mazda's answer to the Toyota Carina ED, Nissan Presea, and Mitsubishi Emeraude — Japanese sedans that attempted to capture the pillarless hardtop look and proportion of large American sedans. Transposed onto a smaller Japanese sedan, this proportion often led to a small, low cabin in context of longer front and rear ends. It was replaced by the ɛ̃fini MS-8 in March 1992, after Persona stocks had run out. The car was only offered new in the domestic Japanese market.
The 1.8-liter engine option had a single camshaft and three valves per cylinder, producing 97 PS (71 kW), while the two-litre option had twin camshafts and four valves per cylinder, with a max output of 140 PS (103 kW). Both engines could also be found in the Capella/626 range and other MA platform cars, although the two-litre was tuned for more torque in this application, and both were fuel injected.

In February 1990 a limited edition ""Persona Couture"" arrived, only available in Silver Stone Metallic paint. It was fully equipped, with air condition and ABS brakes over the Type B, and only available with the larger engine in combination with the automatic transmission. It sold for ten percent more than a 2000 Type B. The Persona underwent a minor change in March 1990, with new body colors and more equipment, such as a power seat and optional ABS brakes. The 12-valve 1.8 was replaced by a twin-cam 16-valve unit which had already been seen in the Eunos 300, producing 115 PS (85 kW). Unlike the case of the Eunos, however, the 2-liter FE DOHC engine remained unchanged. Production came to a halt in December 1991, although the car remained on sale for another three months.
Mazda placed much emphasis on the Persona's interior, marketing the car under the tagline ""Interiorism"" (インテリアイズム, Interiaizumu). It featured lounge-style door trims that appears completely integrated into the rear seats when the doors are closed, while the front seat belts were mounted in the rear doors to be as discreet as possible. It won a prize for ""Best Car Interior"" in 1988. Other unusual details were the absence of ashtrays as well as a cigarette lighter - they were available as a cost option.

21032233.0,0,Mazda RX-01,"The Mazda RX-01 was a concept car produced by Mazda that debuted at the 1995 Tokyo Motor Show.
Created partially in response to the state of the economy at the time and the resultant shrinkage of the high-end sports car market, the RX-01 undertook a back-to-basics approach of a compact, simple, fun-to-drive, yet inexpensive sports car much like the first generation RX-7. (By this time, the RX-7 had evolved into an uncompromising ""super sports car"" boasting ultra high performance with little creature comfort and a high price tag.) The RX-01 boasted a radical front end with a floating bumper/spoiler made possible by its compact rotary engine as well as a 2+2 seating arrangement.
The RX-01 featured the public appearance of the next generation of Mazda rotary engine design, the 13B-MSP. A naturally aspirated Wankel engine, its exhaust ports were now located in the side housing instead of the periphery of the rotor housing, thus preventing overlapping intake and exhaust port timing. This has several benefits: higher output, improved thermal efficiency, better fuel economy, and cleaner emissions. The 1308 cc engine produces 220 bhp at 8500rpm. Acceleration from 0-60 mph is claimed to be 5.7 seconds.
While it was hoped by enthusiasts that the RX-01 would be put into production as the next iteration of Mazda's rotary sports car and made available to world markets (the RX-7 was discontinued in North America after 1995), the declining interest in sports car over SUVs and Mazda's financial state at the time conspired to keep RX-01 merely a concept car.

It was based on the Australian Holden HJ and HX series Premier. Premiers were shipped to Japan without engines or transmissions, and Mazda fitted a 1.3-liter 13B Wankel engine into the bay. The engine produced 130 hp (97 kW) but just 102 lb⋅ft (138 N⋅m) of torque, meaning the Roadpacer performed rather poorly as it weighed 1,575 kg (3,472 lb). The Roadpacer was introduced to compete with large Japanese flagship sedans Toyota Century, Nissan President, Isuzu Statesman de Ville, and the Mitsubishi Debonair. The Roadpacer was conceived just years before Mazda entered into an engineering partnership with Ford at around the same time the Roadpacer was sold.
The 13B produced less power than the Red series motors that powered the equivalent Holdens, and significantly less torque, meaning performance was restrained with a 166 km/h (103 mph) top speed, poor acceleration and terrible fuel consumption. Contemporary reports suggest 9 mpg (26 L per 100 km). The three-speed automatic transmission with a steering column shift lever was sourced from Jatco and was shared with the LA series Mazda Luce. The vehicle was not in compliance with Japanese regulations concerning engine displacement and exterior dimensions, and was classed in the mid-size car segment, while the engine displacement placed it in the lower annual road tax brackets. If the car was recognized as being for business use as an executive company car, the road tax bill was very minimal.
While the Holden HJ Premier itself was well equipped, Mazda decided to add more. Gadgets of note include a central locking system that activated when the car hit 10 km/h (6.2 mph), a chime system that activated at 90 km/h (56 mph), a dictation system and a stereo able to be controlled from both front and back seats. The interior was offered with a choice of velour upholstered bucket seats and a center console for the front passengers or a split front bench seat. The Roadpacer was built only for the Japanese market, and certain aspects concerning its lack of speed become evident once its realized that urban two-way streets are usually zoned at 40 km/h (25 mph) or less, as mentioned in the article Speed limits in Japan.

The price was also considered high at  ¥3.8 million yen (US$13,000) in 1975 ($62,524 in 2020 dollars ). This was about twice the price of a contemporary Mazda Cosmo or Mazda Luce. Originally intended as transport for high-ranking government officials, the car was sold in the wake of the first fuel crisis and was not a commercial success. Production ceased in 1977 with only 800 units sold.
The Roadpacer AP has the sole distinction of being the only General Motors product being fitted for production with a rotary engine, and the platform used was only the shorter version used by Isuzu for the Statesman de Ville.
Most were sold to government departments and were later crushed, meaning Roadpacers are rare nowadays; their counterpart model, the Holden Premier is considered a classic car in Australia.One can be found on display in the Transport World Motor Museum in Invercargill, New Zealand.

Over the years, displacement has been increased and turbocharging has been added. Mazda rotary engines have a reputation for being relatively small and powerful at the expense of poor fuel efficiency. The engines became popular with kit car builders, hot rodders and in light aircraft because of their light weight, compact size, tuning potential and inherently high power-to-weight ratio—as is true for all Wankel-type engines.

Internally referred to as W121 (BII or B2), it was first shown in prototype at the 1954 New York Auto Show, and was available with an optional removable hardtop.
The 190 SL presented an attractive, more affordable alternative to the exclusive Mercedes-Benz 300 SL, sharing its basic styling, engineering, detailing, and fully independent suspension. Both cars had double wishbones in front and swing axles at the rear.  Instead of the 300 SL's expensive purpose-built W198 tubular spaceframe, the 190 SL's R121 structure used a shortened unitary floorpan modified from the W121 base saloon.The 190 SL was powered by a new, slightly oversquare 105 PS (77 kW; 104 hp) Type M121 BII 1.9 L straight-four SOHC engine. Based on the 300 SL's straight six, it had an unchanged 85 mm bore and 4.3 mm reduced 83.6 mm stroke, was fitted with twin-choke dual Solex carburetors, and produced gross 120 hp (89 kW; 122 PS). In detuned form, it was later used in the W120 180 and W121 190 models.
The car was available either as a soft-top convertible (initially priced at DM 16,500/US$3,998) or with removable hardtop (DM 17,650/$4,295). A small third-passenger transverse seat was optional. During its first years the 190 SL was available as a sports-racing model with small perspex windscreen and spartan one-piece leather covered bucket seats and aluminium doors. In 1959, the hardtop's rear window was enlarged.
In 1956, a few six-cylinder prototypes were built for testing. A 190SL with a unique engine, using the 300SL block, squeezed into the engine bay with a one-off mix of Benz-bin parts was entered in the 1956 Alpine Rally, but the costs of production would be prohibitive. Two other prototypes, fitted with fuel injected M180 220SE engines were baptised the W127 / 220SL. In June 1956, Rudi Uhlenhaut and Karl Kling lapped the Nürburgring Nordschleife circuit in the two W127s 25 seconds faster than a regular 190SL. On 12 April 1957, MB's board decided to build the W127, six-cylinder 220SL alongside the 190SL, but production challenges postponed manufacturing until it was overtaken by the 230SL 'Pagoda'.Both the 190 SL and the 300 SL were replaced by the Mercedes-Benz 230SL in 1963.",

The result was a nearly 2-ton sports sedan with muscle car performance.  At the time of its release it was the world's fastest four-door car until the 1971 release of the 228km/h XY GTHO III by Ford Australia.

611005.0,0,Mercedes-Benz 300 SL,"The Mercedes-Benz 300 SL (chassis code W 198) is a two-seat sports car which was produced by Mercedes-Benz as a gullwinged coupe (1954–1957) and roadster (1957–1963). It was based on the company's 1952 racer, the W194, with mechanical direct fuel injection which boosted power almost 50 percent in its three-liter overhead camshaft straight-six engine. Capable of reaching a top speed of up to 263 km/h (163 mph), it was a sports car racing champion and the fastest production car of its time.Max Hoffman, Mercedes-Benz's United States importer at the time, inspired the 300 SL and saw an American market for such a car. The company introduced the 300 SL in February 1954 at the International Motor Sports Show in New York City (instead of Europe) to get it into U.S. buyers' hands sooner.
SL is the short form for ""super-light"" in German (super-leicht) – Mercedes' first use of the designation, referring to the car's racing-bred light tubular-frame construction. The 300 SL was voted the ""sports car of the century"" in 1999.",
3118292.0,0,Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR,"The Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR (W 196 S) was a 2-seat sports racer that took part in the 1955 World Sportscar Championship before a catastrophic crash and fire at Le Mans later that year ended its domination prematurely. The car was designated ""SL-R"" (for Sport Leicht-Rennen, eng: Sport Light-Racing), which was later condensed to ""SLR"". Technically, the W 196 S is based on the W 196 R, but has a slightly different engine, displacing 3 litres.
Just as the W 196 R Formula One racer's M 196 R engine, the W 196 S's M 196 S engine is a direct-injected 3-litre straight 8 engine (but with a 78 mm bore and stroke); its rated power is 276 PS (203 kW).
The W 196 S's monoposto driving position was modified to standard two-abreast seating, headlights were added, and a few other changes made to adapt a strictly track competitor to a 24-hour road/track sports racer.
Two of the nine 300 SLR rolling chassis produced were converted into 300 SLR/300 SL hybrids.  Effectively road legal racers, they had coupé styling, gull-wing doors, and a footprint midway between the two models.
When Mercedes-Benz cancelled its racing programme after the Le Mans disaster, the hybrid project was shelved. Company design chief Rudolf Uhlenhaut, architect of both the 300 SLR racer and the hybrids, appropriated one of the leftover mules as his personal car. Capable of approaching 290 km/h (180 mph), the Uhlenhaut Coupé was by far the fastest road car in the world in its day.

The 450 SEL 6.9 had the distinction of having the first full hydropneumatic suspension system from Mercedes-Benz and world’s first passenger car to be fitted with modern form of ABS, electronic four-wheel multi-channel anti-lock braking system from Bosch, in 1978.For several years, the 450 SEL 6.9 was the quickest-accelerating and fastest European saloon, reaching 100 km/h (62 mph) in 7.4 seconds and 240 km/h (149 mph) top speed.The direct successor of 450 SEL 6.9 is the 2003 Mercedes-Benz S 55 Kompressor AMG (W220, 2003–2005), given the criteria that they were built in limited production and had unique 5.4-litre engine with supercharger not shared with S 500.

The 500 E was created in close cooperation with Porsche. With its engineering department being fully occupied with the development of the new S-Class, Mercedes-Benz commissioned Porsche in 1989 to redesign the W124 chassis to fit the 5.0L V8 used in the SL into it, along with the necessary changes on the suspension system and drive train. When the car was ready, it was found that its widened wings didn't fit through the W124 assembly line in Sindelfingen in three places. Hence Porsche was also commissioned to assemble the car. As a side-effect this arrangement provided workload for Porsche's plant, as the company was in crisis at the time, and its factory capacity was underutilized.During production Mercedes-Benz delivered parts to Porsche's ""Reutter-Bau"" plant in Zuffenhausen (an urban district of Stuttgart) where the 500 E chassis were hand-assembled. When finished the chassis were transported by truck to the Mercedes-Benz assembly plant in Sindelfingen to be painted. As soon as the paint was dry the varnished chassis were then shipped back to Porsche's ""Rössle-Bau"" in Zuffenhausen where the engine was put in and the car completed. For final inspection and delivery the vehicles again were transported to Sindelfingen. This process took a full 18 days per car.
Design began in 1989. Called '500 E' through to model year 1993, for model year 1994 it was face-lifted along with the rest of the range and renamed to 'E 500'. The chassis constructed by Porsche was also used to produce the 400 E (W124.034), that was technically identical to its big brother, save its 4.2L V8 also used in the S-Class and some other minor changes. The 400 E (later renamed 'E 420') was produced in Sindelfingen, since it lacked the widened wings and thus was perfectly understated as it looked like one of its lesser siblings.In Germany, the 500 E first came on sale in late 1990, making its first appearance in the Mercedes-Benz October 1, 1990 pricelist, with a retail price of DM134,520. By January 2, 1993, the price had risen to DM145,590, and would stay at it until the car went off the market in late 1994, it was last available in the August 1, 1994 pricelist.

It was the third in a series of sports cars raced by Mercedes, following the CLK GTRs and CLK LMs that had debuted in 1997 and 1998 respectively.  Like its predecessors the CLR retained elements of Mercedes-Benz's production cars, including a V8 engine loosely based on a design used in some models as well as bodywork based on the CLK and CL-Classes.  The CLR's bodywork was lower in overall height than that used on the CLKs to produce less drag.Three CLRs were entered for Le Mans in 1999 after the team performed nearly 22,000 mi (35,000 km) of testing. The cars suffered aerodynamic instabilities along the circuit's long high-speed straight sections.  The car of Australian Mark Webber became airborne and crashed in qualifying, requiring it to be rebuilt.  Webber and the repaired CLR returned to the track in a final practice session on the morning of the race, but during its first lap around the circuit, the car once again became airborne and landed on its roof.  Mercedes withdrew the damaged CLR but chose to continue in the race despite the accidents.  The remaining cars were hastily altered and the drivers were given instructions to avoid closely following other cars.Nearly four hours into the race Scotsman Peter Dumbreck was battling amongst the race leaders when his CLR suffered the same instability and became airborne, this time vaulting the circuit's safety barriers, crashing into trees and then coming to rest in an open field after several somersaults.  This and earlier incidents led Mercedes not only to withdraw its remaining car from the event immediately, but also to cancel the entire CLR programme and move the company out of sports car racing.  The accidents led to changes in the regulations dictating the design of Le Mans racing cars as well as alterations to the circuit itself to increase safety.

The successor to the M189 version of the company's venerated 3.0 L (183.1 cu in) straight-6 M186, it was introduced in the flagship Mercedes-Benz 600.  In 1968, it was fitted to the high-performance Mercedes-Benz 300SEL 6.3 sports sedan.  The engine was enlarged to 6.8 L (417 cu in) in 1975 for the Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9 (1975-1981).
The M100 featured a cast iron block, aluminum alloy heads, and aircraft-style sodium-filled valves operating against hardened valve seats. As in all Mercedes-Benz automobile engines, the crankshaft, connecting rods and pistons were forged instead of cast. 
Each hand-built unit was bench-tested for 265 minutes, 40 of which were under full load. As introduced, it utilized a mechanical fuel injection system designed and built in-house by Daimler-Benz. The  6.8 L (6,834 cc) version used a Bosch K-Jetronic Continuous Injection System.
The 6.3 L power plant was conservatively rated at 250 PS (184 kW), with 503 N⋅m (371 lb⋅ft) of torque helping to compensate for the 2.82 to 1 final drive ratio necessary for sustained high-speed cruising. 
In non-US trim, the 6.8 L engine produced 286 PS (210 kW) with 550 N⋅m (406 lb⋅ft) of torque. The North American version of it, introduced in 1977, was significantly less powerful at 250 PS (184 kW) and  488 N⋅m (360 lb⋅ft) of torque due to more stringent emissions control requirements.
The 6.9 L M100 used a ""dry sump"" engine lubrication system, which both enhanced longevity and reduced overall engine height. Originally developed for racing as a way to prevent engine oil foaming at high crankshaft RPMs, which in turn would create a serious drop in oil pressure, it allowed sustained high speeds at full engine power.  The M100  system circulated a massive twelve litres of oil through the engine and a storage tank mounted inside the right front fender, as opposed to the usual four or five litres found in V8s with a standard oil pan and oil pump configuration. The dry sump system also had the benefit of extending the oil change interval to 12,500 mi (20,100 km). This, along with hydraulic valve lifters which required no adjusting and special cylinder head gaskets which eliminated the need for periodic retorquing of the head bolts, made the 6.8 nearly maintenance-free for its first 50,000 mi (80,000 km).",

28670520.0,0,Mercedes-Benz M276 engine,"The Mercedes–Benz M276 engine is a direct injected, gasoline automotive piston V6 engine.
The M276 engine is not related to the Chrysler Pentastar except for the 60 degree angle, despite that it was developed while Chrysler was still owned by Daimler AG. This can be seen in its 60 degree vee–angle, as opposed to the 90 degree angle of its M272 predecessor. The 60 degree vee–angle eliminates the need for a balance shaft, improving refinement while reducing mechanical complexity. None of the parts are shared at all.The M276 engine features an aluminum engine block with Nanoslide cylinder coating and dual overhead camshafts with independent variable valve timing on 12 intake and 12 exhaust valves and a new 2–stage timing chain arrangement. The M276 also includes direct injection with piezo–electrically controlled injectors for 2 to 3 sprays per intake stroke in normal operation, multi–spark ignition that creates up to 4 sparks per cycle, and the demand–controlled fuel pump, water pump, oil pump and alternator that reduce parasitic loads.
The first spray of fuel injection creates the base lean burn mixture in the intake cycle, while the later spray(s), up to 4 more times in combustion cycle in difficult conditions for a clean burn, control when and where the ignition starts and how the burn propagates in stratified charge fashion. In combination with a new smaller and more efficient Variable Valve Timing mechanism on all 4 camshafts, the precise combustion control allows a quicker and smoother re–start of the engine for the stop–start system.  This VVT can alter cam timing up to 40 crank degrees with a higher speed than before, and enables limiting the intake charge combined with a normal combustion stroke, thus making the operating process an Atkinson Cycle in partial throttle conditions for better fuel efficiency.  These features are also shared with Mercedes' M278 V8 engine, announced at the same time.Mercedes–Benz claims that the new engine, in conjunction with the demand–controlled ancillaries and the stop–start system, can produce up to a 24% improvement in fuel economy while increasing power and torque over the M272. This efficiency improvement led to the various models with this engine being labeled with Blue Efficiency moniker.
Retaining most of the above characteristics, turbocharged smaller displacement DELA 30 variant was introduced in 2013 for C400 (W205) and subsequently offered on other models without the name Blue Efficiency.
For 2014 CLS400, a turbocharged larger displacement variant named DELA 35 came out to the market with a lower boost of 0.7 bar (10 psi) compared to 1.8 bar (26 psi) of DELA30 resulting in the same power and torque ratings at a lower fuel consumption.In 2015, a higher boost and a slightly lower compression ratio (10.5:1) were used to create a DE30LA version for AMG models, and is used for many AMG and Mercedes–Benz vehicles since.",

The M278 is derived from the company's previous M273 V8 engine, sharing its bore pitch, aluminium engine block, and Silitec aluminium/silicon low-friction cylinder liners. In contrast to the port-injected M273, the M278 features gasoline direct injection, with piezo-electrically actuated fuel injectors for more precise fuel delivery, and multi-spark ignition, which enables the spark plugs to be fired multiple times over the combustion sequence for more efficient combustion. Other changes relative to the M273 include an increased adjustment range for the variable valve timing system, a new timing chain arrangement, and new engine accessories (such as the oil pump, water pump, fuel pump, and alternator) which reduce parasitic loads. Many of these new features are shared with the M276 V6 engine family, which was announced at the same time.While the M273 was naturally aspirated, the M278 features twin turbochargers, one per cylinder bank, producing 0.9 bar (13 psi) boost pressure in most configurations.Mercedes-Benz estimate that these changes, in conjunction with vehicle modifications such as a stop-start system, allow the 4.7–litre M278 to have 22% lower fuel consumption and CO2 emissions than the 5.5–litre M273 while producing more power 320 kW (435 PS; 429 bhp) versus 285 kW (387 PS; 382 bhp) and torque 700 N⋅m (516 lb⋅ft) versus 530 N⋅m (391 lb⋅ft).

The first two were rated by the manufacturer for 72 bhp (54 kW) at 4200 RPM and 96 lb⋅ft (130 N⋅m) of torque at 2800 RPM; the increase in displacement reduced emissions in order to meet US automobile emissions requirements. The commercial vehicle version had 78 bhp (58 kW) in standard variants, the turbocharged version (OM601.970) in the V230 TD and Vito 110D had 96 bhp (72 kW).
It is closely related to the 5 cylinder OM602 and the 6 cylinder OM603 engine families of the same era.
The OM601 was built with an aluminum head on an iron block. The camshafts and fuel injection pump are driven by a duplex chain from the crankshaft. A separate single row chain drives the oil pump from the crankshaft.
Fuel supply is indirect injection via a prechamber arrangement. The OM-601's injection pump is a mechanical fuel injection unit with a 5,150 RPM (+ or - 50 RPM) mechanical governor, automatic altitude compensation, and a 'load sensing' automatic idle speed control.

The 5-cylinder OM602 was succeeded by the four-valve engine OM605  (E250D 20V) and later the OM612 and OM647 with turbocharger and common rail direct injection (C/E/ML 270CDI).

It is closely related to the 4 cylinder OM601 and the 5 cylinder OM602 engine families of the same era.
The 603.96 engine has a capacity of 2,996 cc (182.8 cu in) and was a development of the reliable 5 cylinder OM617 engine. It produced 143 hp at 4600 rpm (euro market without catalytic converter produced 148hp) and 195 ft.lb at 2400 rpm with a compression ratio of 22.0:1. Versions 603.96x and  603.97x are turbocharged. Only turbocharged models of the 603 series were available to the U.S. market. The single camshaft and injection pump are driven by duplex chain from the crankshaft. A separate single row chain drives the oil pump. The camshaft operated the valves via hydraulic bucket tappets; valve clearance adjustment is automatic.
Fuel is injected into a pre-combustion chamber. A Bosch M in-line injection pump is used, with a mechanical governor and vacuum-operated stop control. The pump is lubricated by a connection to the engine oil circulation and the fuel lift pump is mounted on the side of the injection pump. Preheating is by glow plugs with automatic control of preheating time.
The 603 engine had a diesel particulate filter, or trap oxidizer, in the US market. As these were mounted at the cylinder head (modern traps are mounted further away), heat from these trap oxidizers caused failure of the aluminum cylinder heads on the first generation of 603-engined vehicles; debris from the traps could also damage the turbocharger. This first version was sold in the US from 1986 to 1987. Daimler-Benz removed these traps for free, and if the turbocharger had been determined to be damaged it was also replaced. Even without the heat from the trap oxidizers, the original #14 mold cylinder heads were weak and if overheated could crack. In general, the later model #18 or #22 mold cylinder heads are considered to be the definitive cure for cracked heads.In 1990 the 350SD/SDL debuted, using a larger-displacement 3496cc OM603.97 engine that had more torque and a lower top RPM. The engine lived on in the W140 chassis after the W126 production ended, as the 300SD or S350, with a larger yet turbocharger and thus more power and torque. By the time of the 3.5L engine, the cylinder head issues of early 3.0L engine (US 1986-1987) had been corrected. However, in the 3.5L there exists a different situation that appeared on some engines; eventual head gasket erosion, and thus passage of oil into the #1 cylinder. As the 3.0L engine uses the same head oil passage design, yet does not appear to exhibit the problem - it might be that the larger bore in the 3.5 engine, the higher pressures, and resulting smaller head gasket surface area could conspire to cause a gasket erosion issue.",

Mercedes stretched the 'Ponton' saloons into a range that became the automaker's dominant production models until 1959.The 1953 Mercedes-Benz W120, marketed as 180, four-cylinder sedans were Mercedes' second totally new series of passenger cars since World War II, following the 1951 introduction of the top of the range W186 Type 300 “Adenauer”, and replaced the pre-war-designed Type 170 and Type 170 S. Contrasting very visibly with the traditional distinct fenders on that body-on-frame model and the ones before it, the 'Pontons' were Mercedes' first monocoque, unitary body production models.Mercedes expanded the base Ponton model into a diversified line, developing multiple series based on the 180, by introducing more engines and stretching the body. Six-cylinder models received a longer nose, and 'S'-models also a longer passenger compartment, offering more legroom. A six-cylinder coupe and convertible were further derived, and a shortened floorpan of the four-cylinder sedan was also modified to serve as the structure for the Mercedes-Benz 190 SL roadster.
The 'Ponton' saloons were the automaker's main production models until 1959, adding up to 80% of Mercedes-Benz car production between 1953 and 1959, with some models lasting until 1962. The range was succeeded by the range of ""Heckflosse"" or ""Fintail"" models.",

The comparatively short and wide chassis, combined with an excellent suspension, powerful brakes and radial tires gave the W 113 superb handling for its time. The styling of the front, with its characteristic upright Bosch ""fishbowl"" headlights and simple chrome grille, dominated by the large three-pointed star in the nose panel, paid homage to the 300 SL roadster.

This car was remarkably designed and built in eight months for this prestigious and very fast north African event, which was the time that the rules were changed by the Italian organizers; this was done as an attempt to avoid another dominant victory by German manufacturers Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union and to give Italian manufacturers Alfa Romeo and Maserati a chance at victory. The car had a 1.5L supercharged V8 engine; it would have been eligible for the post war Grand Prix period from 1946 to 1951, but it never raced during that time, whereas the Alfa Romeo 158, one of the W165's competitors during the 1939 Tripoli Grand Prix was very much the dominant car during that time. The bigger and more powerful W154 was Mercedes's main Grand Prix car during 1938 and 1939, so the W165 was only used once; there was hardly any other use for it.Following an invitation by Indianapolis Motor Speedway owner Tony Hulman, Caracciola entered a W165  in the 1946 Indianapolis 500.

The official Allied reporting name was ""Zeke"", although the name ""Zero"" (from Type 0) was used colloquially as well.
The Zero is considered to have been the most capable carrier-based fighter in the world when it was introduced early in World War II, combining excellent maneuverability and very long range. The Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service (IJNAS) also frequently used it as a land-based fighter.
In early combat operations, the Zero gained a reputation as a dogfighter, achieving an outstanding kill ratio of 12 to 1, but by mid-1942 a combination of new tactics and the introduction of better equipment enabled Allied pilots to engage the Zero on generally equal terms. By 1943, the Zero was less effective against newer Allied fighters due to design limitations. It lacked hydraulic boosting for its ailerons and rudder, rendering it extremely difficult to maneuver at high speeds. By 1944, with Allied fighters approaching the A6M levels of maneuverability and consistently exceeding its firepower, armor, and speed, the A6M had largely become outdated as a fighter aircraft. However, as design delays and production difficulties hampered the introduction of newer Japanese aircraft models, the Zero continued to serve in a front-line role until the end of the war in the Pacific.

It became a major financier of the regrouped Mitsubishi keiretsu in the following years.Mitsubishi and Dai-Ichi Bank, Japan's oldest bank, began preparations for a merger in 1969, which would have led to a major regrouping in the bank-led keiretsu system of the era. The plan met opposition among Dai-Ichi's management and its customers in the Furukawa and Kawasaki groups, who feared that Mitsubishi would dominate the combined bank and that their businesses would be absorbed by the relatively strong Mitsubishi group. As a result, the merger was called off. Two years later, Dai-Ichi merged with Nippon Kangyo Bank to form Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank (now part of Mizuho Bank).Mitsubishi was known as a very conservative lender and was one of the few Japanese banks to emerge from the Japanese asset price bubble relatively unscathed. It acquired the Nippon Trust Bank in 1994. In 1996, it combined with The Bank of Tokyo to form The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi (now MUFG Bank).
In addition to its home country of Japan, Mitsubishi was also active in California, where it began banking operations in 1972 through Mitsubishi Bank of California. Mitsubishi acquired Bank of California in 1984, which later merged with Bank of Tokyo-controlled Union Bank to form what is now known as MUFG Union Bank.

695766.0,0,Mitsubishi Diamante,"The Mitsubishi Diamante is an automobile that was manufactured by Mitsubishi Motors from 1990 to 2005.
The first series was a hardtop introduced to the public at the Tokyo Motor Show in 1989. It went on sale in Japan exclusively in May 1990 and won that year's Japan Car of the Year award. It was created by splicing an extra 6.6 cm right down the middle of the Mitsubishi Galant, which itself had won the Japan Car of the Year award in 1987. The Diamante's platform was also used for the sporty Mitsubishi 3000GT.The name Diamante was derived from the Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian word for ""diamond"" and was adopted also as homage to the Mitsubishi badge which is composed of three diamonds. In Japan, this vehicle was sold at a specific retail chain called Car Plaza.
From 1991, a more conventional Diamante-derived Mitsubishi Sigma sedan was also built in Japan for its domestic and European export markets. It became the basis of the second generation Magna independently built in Australia. Its Australian luxury derivate, sold as the Verada, became the Diamante for export markets including New Zealand and North America a year later. The Wagon version was also exported including to Japan.
There have been rumors that the Diamante was either not intended for a Japanese launch, or it might have been planned as a low-volume model. The reason for this argument is that until 1989, the width of vehicles was a vital indication of taxation class. The Diamante, being wider than the 1,700 mm (66.9 in) breakpoint, would have suffered a large tax penalty against most of its rivals, which were designed to be just under limit. At the time, Mitsubishi's international image was also considered less than ideal for the marketing of a luxury car—its most expensive offering at the time, the Debonair, was largely seen as a company car project for Mitsubishi conglomerate executives. The Diamante's introduction was the result of the Honda/Acura Legend, which caught manufacturers by surprise when it appeared in 1986, inspiring the creation of the Lexus and Infiniti divisions, as well as various executive car class vehicles to be revised as a result. Mitsubishi needed to compete with the Legend and the Diamante was the result.
However, the tax situation had changed in 1989, and the Diamante became the surprise hit of 1990. Amidst Japan's bubble economy, many private car owners sought an executive car in a market that had very few new offerings that year.",

Based on the PS platform, it was the first vehicle built under Mitsubishi's ""Project America"", a program aimed at introducing vehicles for North America without having to compromise to accommodate other export markets.

Its design origins can be traced back to the Mitsubishi SSU which debuted at the 1999 North American International Auto Show, although the Endeavor does not share the concept's mechanical underpinnings. The prototype was powered by a 305 hp (227 kW) version of the 6A13TT 2.5 liter twin-turbo V6, which directed the power to a full-time all wheel drive system through its INVECS-II five-speed automatic transmission and AYC. When the Endeavor debuted, it used the 6G75 3.8 liter V6 offering 215 hp (160 kW) (improved to 225 hp (168 kW) in 2004) and 250 lb⋅ft (339 N⋅m), mated to a four-speed automatic transmission with an optional all-wheel-drive system that splits the torque 50/50 by default. In 2011, the Endeavor again featured a 3.8L V6 but upgraded once more to produce 225 hp (168 kW) and 255 lb⋅ft (346 N⋅m) of torque. It received a mild restyle for the 2006 model year.
Despite some reasonably favorable reviews on its release, the Endeavor's performance in the marketplace failed to meet Mitsubishi's expectations. On its release in March 2003 the company aimed for 80,000 annual sales but achieved only 32,054 by the end of its debut year, and sales fell every year since.

""leaf roll"") due to the cylindrical shape of its fuselage. The Allied reporting name was ""Betty"".Designed to a strict specification to succeed the Mitsubishi G3M already in service, the G4M boasted very good performance and excellent range and was considered the best land-based naval bomber at the time. This was achieved by its structural lightness and an almost total lack of protection for the crew, with no armor plating or self-sealing fuel tanks. The G4M was officially adopted on 2 April 1941 but the aforementioned problems would prove to be a severe drawback, often suffering heavy losses; Allied fighter pilots nicknamed the G4M ""The Flying Lighter"" as it was extremely prone to ignition after a few hits. It was not until later variants of the G4M2 and G4M3 that self-sealing fuel tanks, armor protection for the crew and better defensive armament was installed.
Nevertheless, the G4M would become the Navy's primary land-based bomber. It is the most widely produced and most famous bomber operated by the Japanese during  World War II and it served in nearly all battles during the Pacific War.

All use two litre turbocharged inline four-cylinder engines and all-wheel drive systems.The Evolution was originally intended only for Japanese markets, but demand on the ""grey import"" market led the Evolution series to be offered through Ralliart dealer networks in the United Kingdom and in various European markets from around 1998. Mitsubishi decided to export the eighth generation Evolution to the United States in 2003 after witnessing the success Subaru had in that market with their long-time direct rival, the Subaru Impreza WRX STi.Japanese-spec versions of all Evos until the release of the Evo IX in 2005 were limited by a gentlemen's agreement to advertise no more than 280 PS (206 kW; 276 hp).

39722957.0,0,Mitsubishi MCA,"Mitsubishi MCA stands for Mitsubishi Clean Air, a moniker used in Japan to identify vehicles built with emission control technology. The term was first introduced in Japan, with later introductions internationally. The technology first appeared in January 1973 on the Mitsubishi 4G32A gasoline-powered inline four cylinder engine installed in all Mitsubishi vehicles using the 4G32 engine, and the Saturn-6 6G34 six-cylinder gasoline-powered engine installed in the Mitsubishi Debonair. The technology was installed so that their vehicles would be in compliance with Japanese Government emission regulations passed in 1968.
Emission reducing technology began with the installation of a positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) valve (MCA-I), followed by the addition of a thermo reactor air pump and catalytic converter in addition to an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve (MCA-II) and a solenoid controlled automatic choke installed on the carburetor.
The MCA-Jet system has a small third valve separate from the intake and exhaust valves. Separate passages in the intake manifold feed each MCA-Jet valve. Since these passages are smaller than the main intake manifold passages, the air/fuel mixture must move faster. When the faster moving air/fuel mixture from the MCA-Jet valve hits the slower moving air/fuel mixture from the intake valve, a strong air swirling effect occurs that promotes more complete combustion. With MCA-Jet it was found that stable combustion could be obtained even with large amounts of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), NOx could be reduced, and combustion improved. Honda's CVCC Stratified charge engine approach also used a small third valve, but sent a richer air/fuel mixture to a small pre-combustion chamber near the spark plug, to help ignite a leaner air/fuel mixture in the main combustion chamber. MCA-Jet was a simpler system that sent the same air/fuel mixture to all intake and MCA-Jet valves. Each MCA-Jet valve is quite small and may be prone to carbon build-up, causing the MCA-Jet valve(s) to stick open. If a Mitsubishi-designed engine has low compression, the MCA-Jet valve(s) could be the cause. Each MCA-Jet valve and valve seat are a self-contained cylinder-shaped unit that screws into the cylinder head for easy replacement. Aftermarket MCA-Jet valves are available. With the advent of 4-valve-per-cylinder engines, manufacturers typically design the camshaft(s) to open one intake valve slightly before the other to create a swirling effect. This has made the MCA-Jet system obsolete. The MCA-Jet system was used in certain Mitsubishi-designed engines installed in both Mitsubishi-branded and Chrysler/Dodge/Plymouth-branded vehicles during the late 1970s to late 1980s.",

Envisioned as a luxury vehicle for high echelon government officials and top executives, the Model A had to be reliable, comfortable, and a showcase of Japanese craftsmanship. After the war in 1964, Mitsubishi would use this approach again to build an exclusive sedan for government officials and top level executives with the Mitsubishi Debonair.
Based on the Fiat Tipo 3, it was a four-door seven-seat sedan using a town car body style  powered by a front-mounted 26 kW (35 hp) 2.8-litre straight-4 engine driving the rear wheels, and was capable of speeds up to 60 miles per hour (97 km/h). 22 were built at the company's Kobe shipyard, including prototypes, between 1917 and 1921.
Because it was expensive to produce—it was built entirely by hand, with the interior rear compartment furnished with lacquered white cypress—it could not compete with cheaper American and European competition, and Mitsubishi halted production after four years. Concentrating instead on its successful Fuso commercial vehicles, the Model A would be the company's last passenger car until the Mitsubishi 500 of 1960.

18419208.0,0,Mitsubishi Motors concept cars,"Mitsubishi Motors concepts are those prototype and concept cars exhibited around the world by Mitsubishi Motors. In common with other automakers, Mitsubishi has used concept cars as both show cars—stylistically adventurous motor show exhibits with no production intentions behind them—or as precursors of future models destined for mass production.The first Mitsubishi concept car was a two-seat convertible version of the Colt 600, which was introduced at the 9th Tokyo Motor Show in 1962 by Shin Mitsubishi Heavy-Industries, one of the companies which would combine to form Mitsubishi Motors in 1970. Although the company had no intention of marketing it, the convertible helped attract the public's attention to the more mundane sedan.Latterly, Mitsubishi has exploited its heritage in its motor show exhibits, using vehicles from its past displayed in parallel with new model introductions. The Colt 600 convertible was brought out from the Mitsubishi Museum in 2005, alongside the new cabriolet version of the Mitsubishi Colt which debuted at the 75th Geneva Motor Show. The following year they revisited the theme by promoting the newest version of their Mitsubishi Pajero sport utility vehicle alongside a 1934 Mitsubishi PX33, a pre-World War II military prototype which was the first Japanese sedan equipped with four-wheel drive. They took the same approach a third time in 2007, with the tenth iteration of the rallying-derived Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution. It was exhibited at the North American International Auto Show in 2007 alongside the Mitsubishi Lancer 1600 GSR, which gained renown after winning the Safari Rally in 1974.",

The original Airtrek name was chosen to ""describe the vehicle's ability to transport its passengers on adventure-packed journeys in a 'free-as-a-bird' manner"", and was ""coined from Air and Trek to express the idea of footloose, adventure-filled motoring pleasure."" The Outlander nameplate which replaced it evoked a ""feeling of journeying to distant, unexplored lands in search of adventure.""The second generation of the vehicle was introduced in 2006 and all markets including Japan adopted the Outlander name, although production of the older version continued in parallel. It was built on the company's GS platform, and used various engines developed by Mitsubishi, Volkswagen, and PSA Peugeot Citroën. PSA's Citroën C-Crosser and Peugeot 4007, which were manufactured by Mitsubishi in Japan, are badge engineered versions of the second generation Outlander. Global sales achieved the 1.5 million unit milestone in October 2016, 15 years after its market launch.As part of the third generation line-up, Mitsubishi launched in January 2013 a plug-in hybrid model called Outlander PHEV.

8317822.0,0,Mitsubishi PX33,"The Mitsubishi PX33 is a prototype passenger car built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the company which would eventually sire Mitsubishi Motors. Commissioned for military use by the Japanese government in 1934, it was the first Japanese-built sedan to have full-time four-wheel drive, a technology the company would return to fifty years later in pursuit of motorsport success. Four working prototypes were built, and a version was in development using Mitsubishi's 6.7 litre, 70 PS (51 kW; 69 hp) 445AD powerplant, Japan's first direct injection diesel engine. However, the entire PX33 project was cancelled in 1937 after the government decided to prioritize Mitsubishi's manufacturing capabilities on commercial development of trucks and buses. In 1937, another Japanese company Tokyu Kurogane Kogyo began production of a smaller four-wheel drive car called the Kurogane Type 95.
The PX33 received renewed attention as a marketing tool for Mitsubishi during the release of the fourth generation Mitsubishi Pajero.

The Pajero nameplate derives from Leopardus pajeros, the Pampas cat.The Pajero, Montero, and Shogun names were also applied to other, mechanically unrelated models, such as the Pajero Mini kei car, the Pajero Junior and Pajero iO/Pinin mini SUVs, and the Triton-based Pajero/Montero/Shogun Sport mid-size SUVs.

Based on a lengthened Minica platform, it was a larger version of the Mitsubishi Pajero Mini, a kei car.  The biggest visual difference from the Pajero Mini is the wide fender trims and wider tyres, giving it a more purposeful appearance. It did benefit from moderate ownership costs to Japanese buyers, due to the exterior dimension being within the favorable compact size class according to Japanese Government dimension regulations, and the small displacement engine obligated a minimal annual road tax, although at reduced advantage compared to the kei car-based Pajero Mini.
For normal use, a basic rear wheel drive configuration is used for road performance and fuel consumption purposes.  However, it also has a selectable (which Mitsubishi called ""Easy-Select 4WD"") four wheel drive system (low and high gear ratios) for off-road driving.  Unlike many other mini SUVs, the Pajero Junior is said to be a very capable off-road vehicle with a decent amount of ground clearance.The 1094cc engine block is the same as used in the Mitsubishi Colt, developing 80 hp at 6500 rpm and giving the vehicle a top speed of 135 km/h.  The steering is a traditional rack and pinion setup, with power assistance.  The front suspension is double wishbone, and the rear is helical spring.
The Mitsubishi Pajero Junior was discontinued in June 1998 due to the launch of its replacement, the Mitsubishi Pajero iO (known in Europe as the ""Pinin"").  By that time, Mitsubishi were aware that many Pajero Juniors were being unofficially exported to other countries, so an entirely new model was designed to take the vehicle away from its kei car roots and to support larger engine sizes for the international market, although only form factors and engines that fit within Japanese compact class were available for the newer car.",

The cars were sold at the Mitsubishi Japan dealership chain called Car Plaza. RVR is an acronym for ""Recreation Vehicle Runner"". In addition, the original logo had a Cyrillic Я on the first letter, so that it reads ЯVR. It had a convenient size passenger cabin and spacious 4–5 person capacity with a youth-oriented approach, making it appealing to young people. Television commercials in Japan used Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck as spokespeople.

It was a tall wagon with some off-road characteristics, targeting the ""sports gear"" or outdoor lifestyle market. This approach was similar to the one used by Honda when they introduced the Honda CR-V. The RVR had an especially good sales record in the beginning, even with the decline of the RV sales boom.

The Raider filled the gap in the Mitsubishi lineup since the discontinuation of the Mighty Max in 1996. Though Mitsubishi was still building their own Triton at the time, it would have been subject to the chicken tax, while an American-built pickup was not. Chrysler manufactured the Raider alongside the Dakota at their Warren Truck Assembly plant in Warren, Michigan, but they were sent to Normal, Illinois, for installation of some Mitsubishi-specific parts and for distribution. Engine choices had included a 4.7 L PowerTech V8 making 230 hp (172 kW) and 290 lb⋅ft (393 N⋅m) and a 3.7 L PowerTech V6 which produced 210 hp (157 kW) and 210 lb⋅ft (285 N⋅m), though by the 2008 model year, only the 3.7 L V6 was available.

Early sales were disappointing, at only one tenth of the Dakota's. As Mitsubishi dealers reportedly had a six-month supply of Raiders on their lots the company was obligated to request that Daimler Chrysler cut production. 9,861 Raiders were built in 2005, and just 297 more were built from the first of the year through March 11, 2006. New for 2006 was the ""slammed"" DuroCross version, which has lower suspension and an aggressive body kit.

The name originated with the 1968 Datsun Cabstar, but this was gradually changed over to ""Nissan"" badging in the early 1980s. The lighter range (1-1.5 tons) replaced the earlier Cabstar and Homer, while the heavier Caball and Clipper were replaced by the 2-4 ton range Atlas (kana:日産・アトラス). The nameplate was first introduced in December 1981.The Cabstar is known also as the Nissan Cabstar, Renault Maxity and Samsung SV110 depending on the location. The range has been sold around the world. It shares its platform with the Nissan Caravan. In spring 2014, Cabstar is now known as NT400.",

Between 1976 and 1997, a rebadged version of the Caravan sold as the Nissan Homy, which was introduced as an independent model in 1965. Outside Japan, the Caravan was also sold as either the Nissan Urvan or Nissan King Van, or earlier with Datsun badging.
All generations use a cabover approach due to Japanese Government dimension regulations that annually tax larger vehicles, and the cabover approach maximizes interior space while remaining within defined exterior dimensions.
Prior to 1973, the Caravan's twin, the Homy, had been offered as a standalone generation from 1965 until 1976. The Homy was built and sold by the Prince Motor Company before the merger of Nissan in 1965 and the Homy was the first vehicle to be acquired by Nissan. After the merger in August 1966, because Nissan didn't have a large passenger platform, the Prince Homy was ""badge engineered"" as the Caravan, and the brand name was changed from Prince to Nissan. The merger was complete by 1970. It shared a chassis with the Prince Homer, a medium-duty cabover pickup truck.
The second generation Homy of 1976, was marketed as a twin to the 1973-era Nissan Caravan, sold at the Nissan Prince Store dealerships, while the Caravan was exclusive to Nissan Bluebird Store locations. The first generation series B640 which was changed to Nissan series T20 was built from 1965 to 1976, the second generation E20 was built from 1976 to 1980, and the third generation E23 was built from 1980 to 1986. The final generation E24 was built from 1986 to 1999, and replaced by the Nissan Elgrand.
Mechanically, the Nissan Caravan and the Nissan Homy were identical. Its traditional competitor from Toyota is the HiAce.Nissan's largest passenger van is the Nissan Civilian, introduced in 1959, and their smaller platform was the Nissan Vanette.",
1661070.0,0,Nissan Cedric,"The Nissan Cedric (Japanese: 日産・セドリック, Nissan Sedorikku) is a large automobile produced by Nissan since 1960. It was developed to provide upscale transportation, competing with the Prince Skyline and Gloria which were later merged into the Nissan family. In later years, the Nissan Skyline was positioned as a sports sedan/coupe, whereas the Nissan Gloria was turned into a sporty version of the Cedric (with identical styling but using a different radiator grille and front & rear light clusters).
In Japan, the Cedric/Gloria series was affectionately called CedGlo, and this long-running series finally came to an end in October 2004, replaced by the Nissan Fuga. The Cedric name is still in use, on the Y31 series fleet vehicle traditionally used as a taxi, where it competes with the Toyota Comfort, and is still in production. Throughout the many versions of the Cedric, it was always considered to be the prime competitor to the Toyota Crown. The hood ornament was inspired by the diamond pattern used by Lincoln but was changed to two right angles set next to each other.
During the 1970s, it briefly saw other Japanese competitors introduce large sedans: the Mitsubishi Debonair, while the Isuzu Statesman de Ville and the Mazda Roadpacer were derived from General Motors-Australia products and were short-lived. In 1985 Honda introduced its rival to Cedric called Legend, which influence the Japanese car makers that time to update their luxury car line up. 
The Cedric name was inspired by the main character, Cedric, in Frances Hodgson Burnett's novel Little Lord Fauntleroy by the Nissan CEO at the time Katsuji Kawamata.",

After production of the A31 stopped, the Cefiro dropped its sporting pretensions and essentially saw the standalone Cefiro model deleted from the lineup. This came with the introduction of the A32 and A33 Maxima, which took on the Cefiro nameplace in the Japanese domestic market although it bore no mechanical relation to the A31. The A32 and A33 closely follow the lineage of the J30 Maxima which was produced at the same time as the A31 Cefiro. The second generation (A32) and third (A33) generation Cefiro saw the switching to the front-wheel drive layout with a V6 engine. In Europe, the Middle East, New Zealand and Australia, the A32 and A33 series models were sold new as the Nissan Maxima. It is also badge engineered as the Renault Samsung SM5.
In North America, the Middle East, and Africa, Nissan retailed the A32 and A33 series Cefiro sedans through the Infiniti brand as the Infiniti I30 and later as the Infiniti I35. While the styling of the Infiniti versions was essentially identical to the Cefiro sold in other markets, the same car with revised front- and rear-styling was also sold in North America as the Nissan Maxima as cheaper, lower-specification model.

In Japan, the Cherry was exclusive to Nissan Cherry store locations.
On the UK market, it debuted just before the company's surge in sales, which saw it sell just over 6,000 cars in 1971 and more than 30,000 the following year.

1778434.0,0,Nissan Cima,"The Nissan Cima (Japanese: 日産・シーマ, Nissan Shīma) is a luxury sedan produced by Nissan for the Japanese market. The car's name is derived from Spanish for ""summit"". Earlier generations installed a hood ornament with an image of an acanthus leaf. The acanthus leaf was commonly used by classical Greeks to make a wreath for use as a crown.
In Japan, the Cima has traditionally been Nissan's rival to the Toyota Crown Royal Saloon G and later the Majesta. The Cima in the first two generations was a more luxurious and larger version of the Cedric and Gloria, with the Cima sharing the V8 engine from the earlier flagship President, Nissan's alternative to the Toyota Century. The Cima was introduced in 1988 and was based on an elongated Cedric/Gloria chassis. With its phenomenal sales—about 64,000 units sold the first year and 120,000 in four years—the car became a symbol of the ""bubble economy"".
The Cedric Cima was sold at Nissan Motor Stores, while the Gloria Cima was sold at Nissan Prince Stores. Later generations of the Cima shared the same platform as the President, with the Cima being a shorter version, thereby allowing Nissan to continue offering the Cima at Nissan Prince Store locations. The later iterations of the Cima were exported to the United States as the Infiniti Q45. The Q45 was discontinued after 2006, however the Cima and the President continued in production until August 2010, leaving the Fuga to become the lone flagship. April 2012, the Cima nameplate was resurrected, and resumed ""flagship"" status in Japan as a longer wheelbase version of the Fuga Hybrid.
In January 2021, Nissan announced that the Cima had been considered for cancellation for a second time, with production being halted at the end of 2020 while the current Nissan Japan website still lists it as available for new orders with a hybrid powertrain only in three trim levels. According to the Nissan Factory website at Tochigi, the Cima was renewed October 2021.

Founded in 1928 by Yoshisuke Aikawa, the group was originally a holding company created as an offshoot of Kuhara Mining Co.(became Nippon Mining & Metals Company; currently part of JXTG Holdings), which Aikawa had taken over as president of from his brother-in-law, Fusanosuke Kuhara. After the bankruptcy of the Kuhara zaibatsu following World War I, Aikawa reorganized its assets into Japan Industries or Nihon Sangyo Corporation (日本産業株式会社, Nihon Sangyō kabushiki gaisha), Nissan for short.
The group's core business was real estate and insurance with hundreds of member companies, including fisheries, mining companies, and is affiliated with Hitachi Group companies, as well as what Nissan is now known for—its automobile industry.  After World War II, the zaibatsu was disbanded, and reformed into Nichiyo-kai, otherwise known as Nissan Group.
Although the Nissan name was primarily known for its car manufacturing outside Japan, Nissan Motors was a comparatively small side business compared to its core real estate business until the real estate crash of the early 1990s (see Japanese asset price bubble).  Like the similar subprime crisis, the crash dealt a devastating blow to the Nissan Group by leaving it with several hundred billions of dollars of debt.
The Nissan Group has long since shed the majority of its real estate assets (which were sold to Mitsui & Co. and still operates as the Bussan Real Estate Company), and has focused on manufacturing and insurance. Nissan Motors was given more independence as French automotive manufacturer Renault bought a 38.8% stake in the company for $5.4 billion in 1999 and appointed Carlos Ghosn as CEO of the new Renault–Nissan Alliance. Nissan Motors' successful turnaround was attributed to CEO Ghosn's ability to detach it from its keiretsu connections and eliminate 23,000 jobs from the Japanese workforce.

39805210.0,0,Nissan NAPS,"NAPS stands for Nissan Anti Pollution System a moniker used in Japan to identify vehicles built with emission control technology. The technology was installed so that their vehicles would be in compliance with Japanese Government emission regulations passed in 1968. The term was first introduced in Japan, with an externally mounted badge on the trunk of vehicles equipped. Nissan's implementation began with the Y44E V8 engine installed in the Nissan President along with all vehicles installed with the Nissan L engine and the Nissan A engine in 1975. The initial introduction of Nissan's technology was the installation of an exhaust gas recirculation valve, followed with the addition of a catalytic converter and an air pump that added oxygen into the exhaust to promote higher temperatures in the catalytic converter, thus cleaning the exhaust further.
The NAPS-Z technology, introduced in 1978, was developed with assistance from Hitachi. It uses a novel implementation of two spark plugs per cylinder, called dual ignition together with electronically controlled fuel injection, installed on the Nissan Z engine. This terminology is often confused with the engine installed in the Nissan 280Z, which used the ""L"" engine. However, the NAPS technology was installed in the Fairlady/Z and sold internationally.
Another version of the twin spark plug method was introduced on the Nissan Stanza with the CA engine, called NAPS-X, which eventually replaced the NAPS-Z approach. The CA engine implemented a hemispherical cylinder head, an approach used by several auto makers.",

A prototype was first shown at the October 1993 Tokyo Auto show. It was offered with three different inline-four engines: from the original 1.5-liter GA15DE, to a larger 1.8-liter SR18DE, and finally a 2.0-liter SR20DE in the Rasheen Forza. The car has five seats and a rugged, quirky and angularly styled body. It is a very small and short four-wheel drive that is often compared to Eastern European cars in design, particularly the Wartburg 353, but is also reminiscent of Nissan's ""Pike"" cars (Be-1, Pao, Figaro, and S-Cargo). As for the Be-1 and Figaro, Rasheen production was carried out by contract manufacturer Takada Kogyo. It was exclusive to Nissan Japanese dealership network called Nissan Red Stage.
The Rasheen shared its platform with the Nissan Sunny (B14), including adopting the chassis NB14. Rasheen also used powertrain components from the Nissan Pulsar (N14) with four-wheel drive.

It had full-time four wheel drive, Nissan's ATTESA powertrain system. This is a viscous coupling that determines where to send torque based on traction situations. Anti-lock brakes were introduced September 1996 along with various trim packages introduced during the production period. Originally only built with a 105 PS (77 kW) 1.5-liter inline-four, the 125 PS (92 kW) 1.8-liter engine was added to the lineup in January 1997, only available with the automatic transmission. After having been shown at the 1997 Tokyo Motor Show, the even bigger SR20DE-engined Rasheen Forza was added in July 1998. This produced 145 PS (107 kW). By August 2000 production had come to a halt, amidst the restructuring following Carlos Ghosn's ""Nissan Revival Plan"" and Nissan Rasheen was replaced by Nissan X-Trail/Rogue.",

The exterior styling of the S-Cargo was inspired by the Citroën 2CV Fourgonnette delivery van, and interior styling borrowed a Citroën-style single-spoke steering wheel. The name was a double entendre, standing for ""Small Cargo"" and sounding like ""escargot"", the French word for snail, which in turn is a nickname for the Citroën 2CV.
The S-Cargo was introduced at the Tokyo Motor Show in 1989, was originally marketed without Nissan branding and was available by reservation only. Over its two-year production run, 8,000 were produced (variously reported as 12,000).
Because of its origins at Pike Factory, (Nissan's special project group), the S-Cargo—along with the Nissan Figaro, Be-1 and Pao—are known as Nissan's ""Pike cars.""

1042154.0,0,Nissan S30,"The Nissan S30 (sold in Japan as the Nissan Fairlady Z and in other markets as the Datsun 240Z, then later as the 260Z and 280Z) is the first generation of Z GT 3-door two-seat coupés, produced by Nissan Motors, Ltd. of Japan from 1969 until 1978. One of the most successful sports car lines ever produced, the trend-setting S30 was designed by a team led by Yoshihiko Matsuo, the head of Nissan's Sports Car Styling Studio.Seeking to compete head-to-head with established European sports cars, Datsun priced the new 240Z within $200 of the British MGB-GT in the United States, a five-year-old design that showed its age. The 240Z's sleek styling, modern engineering, relatively low price, and impressive performance struck a major chord with the public. Positive response from both buyers and the motoring press was immediate, and dealers soon had long waiting lists for the ""Z"".
As a ""halo"" car, the 240Z broadened the acceptance of Japanese car-makers beyond their econobox image. Datsun's growing dealer network—compared to limited production imported sports cars manufactured by Jaguar, BMW, Porsche, Alfa Romeo, and Fiat—ensured both easy purchase and ready maintenance.
All variants of the S30 have four-wheel independent suspension consisting of MacPherson struts in front (borrowed from the Nissan Laurel C30) and Chapman struts in back. Front disc brakes and rear drums were standard.
The 240Z used twin SU-style Hitachi one-barrel side-draft carburetors. These were replaced on the 260Z with Hitachi one-barrel side-draft carburetors beginning with model year 1973 to comply with emissions regulations, resulting in diminished overall performance. A Bosch-designed L-Jetronic electronic fuel injection was added to US market 280Zs in 1975 to compensate.
Continuing through the 1975–1978 model years, markets outside of the United States (and Japan, which only offered the 2-liter engine from 1974) still received the 260Z coupé and 2+2. The S30 240Z is unrelated to the later 240SX, which is sold as the Silvia in Japan.",

It is a popular inline four-cylinder engine fitted into a variety of cars, generally the Nissan Silvia and 180SX. It also came in the Pulsar GTI-R, Nissan NX Coupe and the Nissan Bluebird. This engine replaced the CA18DE and CA18DET that originally powered the Silvia and 180SX. The CA18 was deemed too expensive to produce and no longer met Japanese emission standards, so it was replaced by the SR20. The SR, just like the out-going CA, was a turbocharged intercooled engine in top form. Nissan also produced a cheaper naturally aspirated version called the SR20DE. In the US and Canada, the Silvia and 180SX are both under the 240SX banner. USDM and Canada 240SXs came stock with the SOHC KA24E for earlier models, or the DOHC KA24DE for later models.  Both are naturally aspirated engines producing 140 hp (100 kW) and 155 hp (116 kW) respectively. SR20DET engine swaps are becoming more commonplace due to the forced induction aftermarket additions available for the SR20DET. Many shops specialize only in SR20DET swaps.

The breakdown of the engine code is as follows:

SR - Engine Code Name
20 - 2.0 Liter Displacement
D  - Dual Overhead Camshaft
E  - Electronic Fuel Injection
T  - Turbocharged

After the merger, the Skyline and its larger counterpart, the Nissan Gloria, were sold in Japan at dealership sales channels called Nissan Prince Shop.
The Skyline was largely designed and engineered by Shinichiro Sakurai from inception, and he remained a chief influence of the car until his death in 2011.
Skylines are available in either coupé, or sedan body styles, plus station wagon, crossover, convertible and pickup/sedan delivery body styles. The later models are most commonly known by their trademark round brake and tail lights. While not distributed in the United States until its importation as the Infiniti G, the Skyline's prominence (particularly for the GT-R variant) in video games, movies and magazines resulted in many such cars being imported there, and makes up a large amount of second-hand Japanese car imports to Europe and North America. The majority of Skyline models are rear-wheel drive, with all-wheel drive being available since the eighth-generation's debut.
The eleventh-generation Skyline (V35) was another major turning point for the nameplate, as it dropped some of the previous generation Skyline's trademark characteristics such as the straight-six engine (replaced with a V6) and turbocharging (reintroduced in the thirteenth-generation/V37 model), and eventually separated the GT-R into its own line. Nissan decided to retain the Skyline for the luxury-sport market segment, while its platform-mate, the 350Z, revived the Z line of pure sports cars. The V35 was the first Skyline made for export to North America, being sold under Nissan's luxury marque Infiniti as the G35 in 2002. The Skyline (V36/J50) is sold in Europe, North America, South Korea, Taiwan, and the Middle East as the Infiniti G37 and EX respectively.
On April 12, 2010 a Guinness Book of Records event took place with 225 Skylines taking part in a parade lap at the ISTS at Silverstone UK, which produced two world records: the most recorded Skylines at one meet at one time, and most Skylines on a track at the same time.",

This model was followed by a brief production run of second-generation cars, under model code KPGC110, in 1973.
After a 16-year hiatus, the GT-R name was revived in 1989 as the BNR32 (""R32"") Skyline GT-R. Group A specification versions of the R32 GT-R were used to win the Japanese Touring Car Championship for four years in a row. The R32 GT-R also had success in the Australian Touring Car Championship, with Jim Richards using it to win the championship in 1991 and Mark Skaife doing the same in 1992, until a regulation change excluded the GT-R in 1993. The technology and performance of the R32 GT-R prompted the Australian motoring publication Wheels to nickname the GT-R ""Godzilla"" in its July 1989 edition. Wheels then carried the name through all the generations of Skyline GT-Rs, most notably the R34 GT-R, which they nicknamed ""Godzilla Returns"", and described as ""The best handling car we have ever driven"" and in their tests covered a quarter of a mile (402 metres) in 12.7 seconds from a standing start time and accelerated from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 4.4 seconds. It was one of the fastest accelerating production vehicles at the time.The Skyline GT-R became the flagship of Nissan performance, showcasing many advanced technologies including the ATTESA E-TS All-wheel drive system and the Super-HICAS four-wheel steering. Today, the car is popular for import drag racing, circuit track, time attack and events hosted by tuning magazines. Production of the Skyline GT-R ended in August 2002. The car was replaced by the R35 GT-R, an all-new vehicle based on the V36 Skyline platform. Although visibly different, the two vehicles share similar design features and are manufactured in the same factory.
The Skyline GT-R was never manufactured outside Japan, and the sole export markets were Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand, in 1991, and the UK (in 1997, due to the Single Vehicle Approval scheme) as used Japanese imports.
Despite this, the car has become an iconic sports car as a Grey import vehicle, including in countries from the Western World (mainly the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Ireland, Canada, and the United States). It has become notable through pop culture such as The Fast and the Furious, Initial D, Shakotan Boogie, Wangan Midnight, Need for Speed, Forza, Driving Emotion Type-S, and Gran Turismo. In 2019, Nismo announced that it would resume production of spare parts for all generations of the Skyline GT-R, including body panels and engines.The car was named at the time by BBC's Top Gear as the only true Japanese contribution in the line of supercars, and by Jeremy Clarkson as one of the best cars in the world.",

This engine has an iron block, aluminum cylinder heads with 4 valves per cylinder and dual overhead camshafts, variable valve timing on the intake camshafts, coil-on-plug ignition, and an available variable intake manifold (5-speed only).  Additionally, the engine has a 10.0:1 compression ratio, a cylinder bore of 87.0 mm, and a piston stroke of 83.0 mm.
A major difference between the VE30DE and the VG30DE engine are the heads. The low under-hood clearance on the 1992–1994 J30 Nissan Maxima demanded a special head to be developed with 30°, rather than 46°, between the valves. Lack of space also demanded a redesigned camshaft drive system, so a special chain drive was developed. The camshafts are driven by a single primary and two secondary chains.  The engine is otherwise similar to the VG30DE.

847272.0,0,Nissan VVL engine,"Nissan Ecology Oriented Variable Valve Lift and Timing (commonly known as VVL & VVT) is an automobile variable valve timing technology developed by Nissan.  VVL varies the duration, and lift of valves by using hydraulic pressure switch between two different sets of camshaft lobes. VVT varies the valve timing throughout the RPM range. Together they function similarly to Honda's VTEC system.
The SR20VE is the most common engine with NEO VVL.  There have been two main versions of this engine.  The first version made 187 hp (139 kW) and 145 lb⋅ft (197 N⋅m) torque.  This engine was used by Nissan from 1997 to 2001.  It is found in the Nissan Primera, Nissan Bluebird, and the Nissan Wingroad.
The second variant of the SR20VE is found only in the 2001 and later P12 Nissan Primera.  This version of the SR20VE makes 204 hp (152 kW), and 152 lb⋅ft (206 N⋅m) torque.  This engine is commonly known as the SR20VE '20V'.  Although, in automotive terms, '20V' would normally be interpreted as having twenty valves, this is incorrect.  The name '20V' is the name of the trim level of the Nissan Primera that it is found in.  It is also a shortened version of the name SR20VE.  This engine has 16 valves like the rest of the SR20 engines.  This newer '20V' engine, along with the SR20VET, were the only SR20 engines to get restyled valve covers.  It also came with an upgraded intake manifold, which has longer runners and a larger 70 mm (2.8 in) throttle body (earlier SR20VE has 60 mm).
Another version of the VVL SR engines, is the 1.6 L SR16VE.  The engine block for the SR16VE is the same as the SR20VE; it also has the same cylinder bore.  The crankshaft has a shorter stroke, which lowers the displacement, but allows the engine to safely rev to higher RPM.  Although this engine has 1.6 L of displacement, it has more aggressive camshaft specifications.  It manages to make 173 hp (129 kW).  The camshafts from this engine are considered to be an upgrade for SR20VE owners.
From 1997 to 1998, Nissan produced 500 limited-edition SR16VE N1 engines. These engines made 197 hp (147 kW). They had further upgraded camshafts, upgraded intake manifold using eight injectors and a larger 70 mm (2.8 in) throttle body. These engines were found in the limited-edition Nissan Pulsar VZ-R N1. They were only sold in Japan.
The most powerful VVL engine so far is the SR20VET.  The SR20VET is a turbocharged '20V' SR20VE.  It uses a Garrett GT2560LS, and makes 280 PS (206 kW; 276 hp). Nissan's technical information about this engine states that it is 9:1 compression ratio, but it really adds up to 8.8:1.  Compared to the SR20DET (used in the Nissan Silvia, and Bluebird), the SR20VET (aside from having VVL technology) has improved airflow in the cylinder head, higher compression, and also improved coolant passages.
In 1998 Nissan's RB engine was also improved using the NEO Head Technology (but no VVL), which provided the motor better fuel economy and lower exhaust emissions to keep up with emission standards.
One difference from Honda's VTEC system is that NEO VVL engages the change of intake and exhaust cams independently for a flatter, more consistent power band. On the SR20VE, the intake camshaft is switched at 5000 rpm, and the exhaust at 6500 rpm.  However this trait was not included on the newer '20V' version, as both camshafts engage at the same RPM.",

At Renault it also replaced the Sofim 8140 engine and is the only truck diesel engine which remained with Nissan Motors when they sold Nissan Diesel to Volvo trucks in 2007.
It features a cast-iron crank case, which is horizontally divided in the crank shaft plane into a lower and an upper part. A set of gear driven balance shafts is located slightly higher than the crankshaft, the vacuum pump is placed on the gear cover and driven by the RH (intake side) balance shaft. The Gerotor oil pump is also located on the front side of the crankshaft. A Serpentine belt with hydraulic tensioner powers the a/c compressor, the water pump and (via a freewheeling pulley to reduce squeaking when engine decelerates) the alternator. A Dual-mass flywheel may be used with manual transmissions.
The aluminium-alloy Crossflow cylinder head houses two camshafts (DOHC) driven by a combined gear and chain drive operating 4 valves per cylinder (16 in total) by bucket tappets.

While the Z16 and Z18 engines had a deck height similar to the earlier L13/L14/L16/L18 variants, the Z24 had a taller deck height to accommodate a longer stroke. The most notable difference between the Z-series engine and its predecessor was the introduction of a new crossflow cylinder head which reduced emissions by moving the intake ports to the right side of the engine opposite the exhaust ports. This change allows the exhaust port velocity to more effectively scavenge the cylinder and reduce reversion pulses to enhance induction. Unfortunately, this change also limits maximum valve lift/lobe lift profiles rendering the cylinder head and valve train configuration undesirable for high-performance uses. The Z series evolved into the NA and KA engines which, along with the smaller CA series, replaced the Z series .

A màndapa is a pillared structure that is open on all sides and protects the person(s) inside from the sun with a roof. By definition, as of the 20th century, mándapas, as temporary structures, are built inside a house or a building and serve as recitation platform during remembrance ceremonies for the dead.
Built by King Nissanka Malla (1187-1196) and named after him, it is located near the western entrance of the Dalada Maluva, the area that contains the oldest and most sacred monuments in the city. A nearby stone inscription identifies this as the building used by Nissanka Malla to listen to pirith (chanting of Buddhist scriptures).The structure is an elevated stone platform with a number of stone columns and surrounded by a low stone wall. These stone columns are the unique feature about the Nissanka Latha Manadapaya, since they are carved in a manner that is found nowhere else in the country. The eight granite columns are arranged in two rows, with four in each row. Presumably used to support a roof, each of them is approximately 8 feet 4 inches (2.54 m) in height. In each of these columns, the crown is carved in the shape of a blossoming lotus bud. The rest of the column is elaborately carved to resemble the stem of the flower. Unlike stone columns commonly seen in the architecture of this period, these are not straight, but are curved in three places.

13266766.0,0,Porsche 3512,"The Porsche 3512 was a motor racing engine designed by Porsche for use in Formula One in the early 1990s.Porsche had left Formula One at the end of 1987 after four years supplying TAG-badged turbo engines to the McLaren team, but decided to return two years later with a view to creating a V12 engine for the newly introduced 3.5-litre normally-aspirated regulations (hence this engine's designation of 3512). After a partnership with the small Onyx team was suggested, in early 1990 the company signed a four-year deal with Footwork Arrows, to commence in 1991.The 3512 was designed by Porsche veteran Hans Mezger, and had an 80-degree V-angle and a power take-off from the centre of the engine. The latter had been a feature of the flat-12 Type 912 engine (also designed by Mezger) in the Porsche 917 sports car of the early 1970s, but was unusual for Formula One.Problems beset the 3512 almost immediately, as it was completed later than scheduled, and its layout meant that it was large and heavy. When ancillaries like the clutch and flywheel were installed, the engine weighed 418 lb (189.6 kg) - compared to the V12s of Honda and Ferrari at 352 lb (159.6 kg) and 308 lb (139.7 kg) respectively. All this meant that it could not be properly installed in Footwork's car for the 1991 season, the FA12, and so the team had to redesign this car while starting the season with a modified version of their 1989/1990 car, designated the A11C.Further difficulties were encountered when the engine started to be used: power output was said to be only around 670 hp (500 kW) at around 13,000 rpm, while the novel method of drawing power from the centre of the engine led to oil pressure problems.When the season got underway at the Phoenix street circuit in the United States, Alex Caffi failed to qualify his A11C, while teammate Michele Alboreto qualified 25th but retired from the race at half-distance with a gearbox failure. At the faster Interlagos circuit for the next round in Brazil, both drivers failed to make the grid. The redesigned FA12 was introduced at the San Marino Grand Prix at Imola, another fast circuit, but Alboreto destroyed his car during practice and was forced to use the A11C, and again both drivers failed to qualify. Then at Monaco, Caffi suffered a crash of his own and once again failed to make the grid, while Alboreto again qualified 25th before his 3512 failed at half-distance.
By this stage, Footwork had already given up hope in the Porsche engine, and had decided to go back to the Ford Cosworth DFR V8 that had been used in 1989 and 1990. However, the team had to make do with the 3512 for the North American rounds in Canada and Mexico, for which Stefan Johansson took the place of Caffi, who had sustained injuries in a road accident. Both drivers managed to qualify at Montreal, Alboreto 21st and Johansson 25th, but retired with throttle and engine problems. Then in Mexico, after four of the team's seven engines for the weekend had failed on the Friday, Johansson failed to qualify, while Alboreto qualified 26th and last, only for his 3512 to fail again before half-distance.
Footwork finally reverted to the DFR in time for the French Grand Prix, installed in a modification of the FA12, designated the FA12C. Porsche formally terminated its deal with the team shortly before the Japanese Grand Prix in October, and has not appeared in Formula One since.
A V10 replacement for the 3512 was in development at the time of Porsche's withdrawal from Formula One. This engine would not be completed until several years later, when it was modified for use in the stillborn Porsche LMP project in 2000. The engine eventually became mass-produced when a further variant was chosen as the powerplant of the Porsche Carrera GT supercar.

Earlier cars designed by the Austrian company include Cisitalia Grand Prix race car, the Volkswagen Beetle, and Auto Union Grand Prix cars.
The 356 is a lightweight and nimble-handling, rear-engine, rear-wheel drive, two-door available both in hardtop coupé and open configurations. Engineering innovations continued during the years of manufacture, contributing to its motorsports success and popularity. Production started in 1948 at Gmünd, Austria, where Porsche built approximately 50 cars. In 1950 the factory relocated to Zuffenhausen, Germany, and general production of the 356 continued until April 1965, well after the replacement model 911 made its September 1964 debut.

While the body was an original design, most of the mechanicals (including engine and suspension) were derived from the Volkswagen Beetle which Ferry's father, Ferdinand Porsche, had designed. 
The aluminum roadster body of the 356/1 was designed by Porsche employee Erwin Komenda in April 1948 at Gmünd and completed only a month later. Smooth and low, the 356/1 set the pattern for later 356s with one fundamental difference; the engine of the production cars was moved behind the rear axle (to reduce costs and make room for two additional seats). The car was registered by the state of Carinthia (Kärnten) with the license plate K45-286 and made its maiden voyage on June 8, 1948.

After testing, the water cooled engine was judged more practical as it gave slightly better performance at 105 horsepower and was also lighter. It was a sedan with independent suspension front and rear, also unusual for the time.

Originally developed as a prototype for a tender to the German Army after World War II, the car never reached mass production after the DKW Munga was chosen over it for reasons of economics.The car was propelled by an induced air-cooled flat-four taken from the Porsche 356, located in the rear of the vehicle like the VWs and Porsches of the period; first in an amended version of the 1.5 litre, with a later bump to 1.6 in the l-model. This engine had an output of around 37 kW (50 HP). Together with a vehicle weight of 990 kilograms a maximum speed of around 100 kilometers per hour could be achieved. For transmission, a 5-speed manual box with additional on-the-fly two/four wheel drive shifter was provided. With its short wheelbase of 2,060 mm, the vehicle had the ability to climb steep grades of up to 65%.
The prototype body of the car was manufactured by Porsche's own Stuttgart Body Works with later versions (stabilized with torsion bars) coming from Karmann coachworks. The monocoque shell came with no doors and high sills, meaning passengers needed to climb over them to enter and exit the vehicle; The upside of this design being that the body was buoyant and amphibious. Later versions of the body came with rigid doors and exhibit a more steeply dropping angle to the front wings/fenders and bonnet–hood.

The Porsche 597 'Hunting Car', alongside the Goliath Type 31 (by the German Federal Armed Forces) were never commissioned for mass production, since, (in the case of the 597), the production costs were too high and the company could not easily supply the sheer numbers of units needed in proposed timescale. Instead the Auto-Union-built DKW Munga model won out for its relative simplicity, lower cost and Auto Union's ability to meet the Army's demand.
A total of 71 Porsche 597s were manufactured, between 1955 and 1958, 49 of which were built for the civilian market (chassis numbers starting from 597-000101). Development costs for the vehicle amounted to approximately 1.8 million DM. In August 1959, there were still hopes within the Porsche company to produce an updated vehicle based on the 597 platform with a strengthened chassis, extended wheelbase of 2,400mm that could be made available in five different body-styles.

The model number comes from the fact that it was built mainly from design drawings for the Type-64 ""record car"". Most mechanical parts came from the VW 38, the prototype of the KdF-Wagen better known as the Volkswagen Beetle.  The chassis was heavily reinforced and the engine also reworked to produce around 40 horsepower. The Type 64 was only a drawing until the three racers were built.  The body was also a compromise in that the cab had to look like a KdF car, but the rest was 'record' car.  The VW beetle was the Type 60, and the name the ""60K10"" means body design 10 for the Type 60 Beetle. Its flat-four engine produced 50 bhp and gave a top speed of around 160 km/h (99 mph).
The body design was made by the Porsche Büro after wind tunnel tests for a planned V10 sports car that never came into existence, the Type 114. Dr. Ingr. Porsche promoted the idea to enter the car into the Berlin-Rome race scheduled for September 1939. The race did not take place but three cars were completed, with aluminium bodies hand shaped by the bodywork company Reutter (which also produced the VW 38 prototypes). One was destroyed  early in World War II. The two remaining cars were used by the Porsche family. Eventually they only used one of them and put the other in storage.In May 1945 American troops discovered the one put in storage, cut the roof off and used it for joyriding for a few weeks until the engine gave up and it was scrapped. The last remaining Porsche 64 was owned by Ferry Porsche who had it restored by Battista Farina in 1947. In 1949 it was sold to the Austrian motorcycle racer Otto Mathé and with it he won the Alpine Rally in 1950. The last time he drove it in a race was at the Monterey Historic Automobile Races in Monterey, California, in 1982. The scrapped car, chassis 38/42, has also been rebuilt and is now on display in the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles.
Otto Mathé retained possession of 38/41 until his death in 1995, and two years later the Type 64 was sold for the second time in its history to Porsche collector and marque expert Dr. Thomas Gruber of Vienna, Austria.

By the early 1960s, Porsche project design numbers had reached into the 800s. For instance, Porsche's 1962 F1 model was called Porsche 804.
At the Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung (Frankfurt Motor Show) in Frankfurt in September 1963, Porsche presented its successor to the Porsche 356 as the 901. It took several more months until the cars were manufactured for sale to customers. Between 14 September and 16 November 1964, 82 cars were built and the 901 was presented in October at the 1964 Paris Auto Salon. There, French car maker Peugeot objected to Porsche using any three digit number where the middle number was 0, asserting ownership of the naming rights in key markets, and having already sold many models with that scheme.
So, Porsche simply replaced the middle 0 with a 1, and called the car Porsche 911. Officially the 901s already constructed were used for testing and for exhibitions, and Porsche sold none to private customers. Nevertheless, several of the cars retained by Porsche at that time appear to have made it to private ownership subsequently: in 1988 number 20 was discovered and completely restored by Kurt Schneider and his wife, Lori. Then in 2010 it was reported that car number 37 was owned by a Porsche specialist named Alois Ruf.Also, other Porsche models were affected, which were primarily intended for racing but also sold as road legal cars. Here, Porsche kept the internal part number of 90x, but sold the car with a name, like

Porsche 904 as Carrera GTS

The previous Porsche 907 only had a 2,200 cc Type 771/1 flat-eight engine developing 270 hp. The new 3-litre Type 908 flat-eight produced 257 kW (350 hp) at 8,400 rpm. Being traditionally air-cooled and with only two valves per cylinder, it still had less power compared to more modern F1 designs which delivered over 400 hp (300 kW), but were not suited to endurance racing.

The 911-derived 935 turbo also won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979. Porsche won the World Championship for Makes in 1976, 1977, 1978, and 1979 with 911-derived models.
